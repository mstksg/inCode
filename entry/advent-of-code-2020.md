Merry Christmas and Happy New Years, to all!

Once again, every year I like to participate in Eric Wastl's *[Advent of
Code](http://adventofcode.com/)*! It's a series of 25 Christmas-themed puzzles
that release every day at midnight --- there's a cute story motivating each one,
usually revolving around saving Christmas. Every night my friends and I
(including the good people of freenode's `##advent-of-code` channel) talk about
the puzzle and creative ways to solve it (and also see how my [bingo
card](https://twitter.com/mstk/status/1343027484808380416) is doing). The
[subreddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode) is also pretty
great as well! And an even nicer thing is that the puzzles are open-ended enough
that there are often many ways of approaching them...including some approaches
that can leverage math concepts in surprising ways, like [group
theory](https://blog.jle.im/entry/alchemical-groups.html), [galilean
transformations and linear
algebra](https://blog.jle.im/entry/shifting-the-stars.html), and [more group
theory](https://blog.jle.im/entry/shuffling-things-up.html). Many of the puzzles
are often simple data transformations that Haskell is especially good at!

Speaking of Haskell, I usually do a write-up for every day I can get around to
about unique insights that solving in Haskell can provide to each different
puzzle. I did them in
[2017](https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2017/blob/master/reflections.md),
[2018](https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2018/blob/master/reflections.md),
and
[2019](https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/reflections.md),
but I never finished every day. But 2020 being what it is, I was able to finish!
:D

You can find [all of them
here](https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2020/blob/master/reflections.md),
but here are links to each individual one. Hopefully you can find them helpful.
And if you haven't yet, why not try [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)
yourself? :) And drop by the freenode `##advent-of-code` channel, we'd love to
say hi and chat, or help out! Thanks all for reading, and also thanks to Eric
for a great event this year, as always!
