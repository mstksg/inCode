The other day I ran into [this video](https://i.imgur.com/tkCsLYM.gifv) of a
pilot of a jet plane apparently pouring water from a bottle into a cup while in
the middle of a roll. The interesting effect is that the water continues to flow
into the cup, apparently defying gravity, throughout the entirety of the roll.
The camera follows the plane's rotation, so it looks like the water is being
poured normally the entire time, even though the ground is seen rotating around
the plane in the background.

In the ensuing discussion, someone commented this was a good example
demonstrating *centrifugal force*. Someone then replied "*Actually, it's the
centripetal force.*"

I replied, and in the process of explaining why centripetal force *doesn't*
explain what is happening here, I came to realize a few key misconceptions that
people have when thinking about "fictitious" (or pseudo-, or inertial) forces.

## Two Sides Of A Coin?

Do you subscribe to this view?

> The centrifugal force is not a "real force", because it's just "the
> centripetal force" in disguise. Every usage of the centrifugal force can be
> re-interpreted as "the centripetal force", and vice versa. It's just two ways
> of looking at the same thing.

This sort of view trains you into thinking that, if you see a "centrifugal
force", you should find the "real force" that is responsible for it. And that
"real force" is "the centripetal force". That's what's *really* happening...
right? Newton's third law!

This fallacy is exactly what struck Commenter B. Commenter B saw something that
could be interpreted as a centrifugal force. Their logic then proceeded thusly:

-   Ah, everyone knows that the centrifugal force isn't a "real force". I have
    to correct it.
-   Well, what's the *real* force behind the water falling into the cup?
-   Isn't the centrifugal force just "the centripetal force", but in a different
    viewpoint?
-   So, it must be "the centripetal force"!

Of course, if you do hold the viewpoint above, this all feels justified. And you
feel satisfied that you were able to [give a name to the
phenomenon](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11730). That is, until you
think about it a little deeper.

Remember, the original question is "When the water is in the air, what is
causing it to move towards the cup?"

If your answer is "the centripetal force", then you have some problems...because
you then have to explain where the force is coming from. It's not gravity, and
it's not the spinning motion of the plane (that's going "sideways", the opposite
direction of a centripetal force). So, what is it? What force is acting on the
water?

How can we have a centrifugal force without a centripetal force?

And that's where you start to see that, no matter what your views on the
metaphysical reality of fictitious forces are, "centripetal force" is certainly
*not* the explanation.

So...what is?

## Down to the root of it

### The Centripetal Fallacy

You might have noticed why I have been writing "the centripetal force" in
quotes. The reason? There is no such thing as "the centripetal force". It's a
lie.

One only needs to check the first words of the Wikipedia articles and compare
the difference to see:

-   **[Centrifugal Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force)**:
    *The centrifugal force is...*
-   **[Centripetal Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force)**: *A
    centripetal force is...*

Huh. One says "the". The other says "a". What's the difference?

The difference is that "centripetal" is a *role* that a force plays. It is an
adjective, like "dampening", "supporting", big, small, little, weak, strong,
upwards-pointing, etc. There is no such thing as "*the* centripetal force", in
the sense that we have "the gravitational force". There are only forces that are
acting in a centripetal way, or play a centripetal role in our current context.

We call a force "centripetal" when it is directed towards a center of rotation,
and causes the object's trajectory to follow a circular path.

There is no such thing as "the centripetal force". There are only forces that
are playing a centripetal role in our system. There might be many, there might
be none, or there might be just one.

Ironically, it's "centrifugal" that is "not a real force", but rather just a
mask that other forces can don and wear.

### Centrifugal Roots

So, what is *the* centrifugal force?
