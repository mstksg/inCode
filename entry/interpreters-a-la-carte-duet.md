"Interpreters a la Carte" in Advent of Code 2017 Duet

This post is just a fun one exploring a wide range of techniques that I applied
to solve the Day 18 puzzles of this past year's great [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017). The puzzles involved interpreting an
assembly language on an abstract machine. The twist is that Part A gave you a
description of *one abstract machine*, and Part B gave you a *different*
abstract machine to interpret the *same language* in.

This twist (one language, but different interpreters/abstract machines) is
basically one of the textbook applications of the *interpreter pattern* in
Haskell and functional programming, so it was fun to implement my solution in
that pattern --- the assembly language source was "compiled" to an abstract
monad once, and the difference between Part A and Part B was just a different
choice of interpreter.

Even *more* interesting is that the two machines are only "half different" --
there's one aspect of the virtual machines that are the same between the two
parts, and aspect that is different. This means that we can apply the "data
types a la carte" technique in order to mix and match isolated components of
virtual machine interpreters, and re-use code whenever possible in assembling
our interpreters for our different machines! This can be considered an extension
of the traditional interpreter pattern: the *modular* interpreter pattern.

This blog post will not necessarily be a focused tutorial on this trick/pattern,
but rather an explanation on my solution centered around this pattern, where I
will also add in insight on how I approach and solve non-trivial Haskell
problems. We'll be using the
*[operational](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/operational)* package to
implement our interpreter pattern program and the
*[type-combinators](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/type-combinators)*
package to implement the modularity aspect, and along the way we'll also use mtl
typeclasses and classy lenses.

The source code is [available
online](https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs)
and is executable as a stack script. This post is written to be accessible for
early-intermediate Haskell programmers.

## The Puzzle

The puzzle is [Advent of Code 2017 Day
18](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/18), and Part A is:

> You discover a tablet containing some strange assembly code labeled simply
> "Duet". Rather than bother the sound card with it, you decide to run the code

>     result of `X` modulo `Y`).
> -   `rcv X` *recovers* the frequency of the last sound played, but only when
>     the value of `X` is not zero. (If it is zero, the command does nothing.)

> program terminates it.
>
> *What is the value of the recovered frequency* (the value of the most recently

> value?

Part B, however, says:

(In each of these, "the program" is a program (written in the Duet assembly
language), which is different for each user and given to us by the site. If you
sign up and view the page, you will see a link to your own unique program to
run.)

What's going on here is that both parts execute the same program in two
different virtual machines --- one has "sound" and "recover", and the other has
"send" and "receive". We are supposed to run the same program in *both* of these
machines.

However, note that these two machines aren't *completely* different --- they
both have the ability to manipulate memory and read/shift program data. So
really, we want to be able to create a "modular" spec and implementation of
these machines, so that we may re-use this memory manipulation aspect when
constructing our machine, without duplicating any code.

## Parsing Duet

First, let's get the parsing of the actual input program out of the way. We'll
be parsing a program into a list of "ops" that we will read as our program.

Our program will be interpreted as a list of `Op` values, a data type
representing opcodes. There are four categories: "snd", "rcv", "jgz", and the
binary mathematical operations:

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L32-L37

type Addr = Either Char Int

data Op = OSnd Addr
        | ORcv Char
        | OJgz Addr Addr
        | OBin (Int -> Int -> Int) Char Addr
```

It's important to remember that "snd", "jgz", and the binary operations can all
take either numbers or other registers.

Now, parsing a single `Op` is just a matter of pattern matching on `words`:

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L39-L52

parseOp :: String -> Op
parseOp inp = case words inp of
    "snd":c    :_   -> OSnd (addr c)
    "set":(x:_):y:_ -> OBin (const id) x (addr y)
    "add":(x:_):y:_ -> OBin (+)        x (addr y)
    "mul":(x:_):y:_ -> OBin (*)        x (addr y)
    "mod":(x:_):y:_ -> OBin mod        x (addr y)
    "rcv":(x:_):_   -> ORcv x
    "jgz":x    :y:_ -> OJgz (addr x) (addr y)
    _               -> error "Bad parse"
  where
    addr :: String -> Addr
    addr [c] | isAlpha c = Left c
    addr str = Right (read str)
```

We're going to store our program in a `PointedList` from the
*[pointedlist](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pointedlist)* package, which
is a non-empty list with a "focus" at a given index, which we use to represent
the program counter/program head/current instruction. Parsing our program is
then just parsing each line in the program string, and collecting them into a
`PointedList`. We're ready to go!

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L54-L55

parseProgram :: String -> P.PointedList Op
parseProgram = fromJust . P.fromList . map parseOp . lines
```

Note that it is possible to skip this parsing step and instead operate directly
on the original strings for the rest of the program, but this pre-processing
step lets us isolate our partial code and acts as a verification step as well,
to get rid of impossible states and commands right off the bat. Definitely more
in line with the Haskell Wayâ„¢.

## Our Virtual Machine

### Operational

We're going to be using the great
*[operational](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/operational)* library[^1] to
build our representation of our interpreted language. Another common choice is
to use *[free](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/free)*, and a lot of other
tutorials go down this route. I always felt like the implementation of
interpreter pattern programs in *free* was a bit awkward, since it relies on
manually (and carefully) constructing continuations.

*operational* lets us construct a language (and a monad) using GADTs to
represent command primitives; it essentially is `Free`, but abstracting over the
continuations we would otherwise need to write using the coyoneda lemma. For
example, to implement something like `State Int` (which we'll call `IntState`),
you might use this GADT:

``` haskell
data StateCommand :: Type -> Type where
    Put :: Int -> StateCommand ()
    Get :: StateCommand Int
```

For those unfamiliar with GADT syntax, this is declaring a data type
`StateCommand a` with two constructors --- `Put`, which takes an `Int` and
creates a `StateCommand ()`, and `Get`, which takes no parameters and creates a
`StateCommand Int`. We give `StateCommand` a *kind signature*, `Type -> Type`,
meaning that it is a single-argument type constructor (`Type` is just a synonym
for `*`).

Our GADT here says that the two "primitive" commands of `IntState` are "putting"
(which requires an `Int` and produces a `()` result) and "getting" (which
requires no inputs, and produces an `Int` result).

You can then write `IntState` as:

``` haskell
type IntState = Program StateCommand
```

which automatically has the appropriate Functor, Applicative, and Monad
instances.

Our primitives can be constructed using `singleton`:

``` haskell
singleton :: StateCommand a -> IntState a

singleton (Put 10) :: IntState ()
singleton Get      :: IntState Int

putInt :: Int -> IntState ()
putInt = singleton . Put

getInt :: IntState Int
getInt = singleton Get
```

With this, we can write an `IntState` action like we would write an action in
any other monad.

Now, we *interpret* an `IntState` in a monadic context using the appropriately
named `interpretWithMonad`:

``` haskell
interpretWithMonad
    :: Monad m                              -- m is the monad to interpret in
    => (forall x. StateCommand x -> m x)    -- a way to interpret each primitive in 'm'
    -> IntState a                           -- IntState to interpret
    -> m a                                  -- resulting action in 'm'
```

If you're unfamiliar with *-XRankNTypes*, `forall x. StateCommand x -> m x` is
the type of a handler that can handle a `StateCommand` of *any* type, and return
a value of `m x` (an action returning the *same type* as the `StateCommand`).
So, you can't give it something like `StateCommand Int -> m Bool`, or
`StateCommand x -> m ()`...it has to be able to handle a `StateCommand a` of
*any* type `a` and return an action in the interpreting context producing a
result of the same type. If given a `StateCommand Int`, it has to return an
`m Int`, and if given a `StateCommand ()`, it has to return an `m ()`, etc. etc.

Now, if we wanted to use `IO` and `IORefs` as the mechanism for interpreting our
`IntState`:

``` haskell
interpretIO :: IORef Int -> (StateCommand a -> IO a)
interpretIO r = \case           -- using -XLambdaCase
    Put x -> writeIORef r x
    Get   -> readIORef r

runAsIO :: IntState a -> Int -> IO (a, Int)
runAsIO m s0 = do
    r <- newIORef s0
    interpretWithMonad (interpretIO r) m
```

`interpretIO r` is our interpreter, in `IO`. `interpretWithMonad` will interpret
each primitive (`Put` and `Get`) using `interpretIO` and generate the result for
us.

The GADT property of `StateCommand` ensures us that the *result* of our `IO`
action matches with the result that the GADT constructor implies, due to the
magic of dependent pattern matching. For the `Put x :: StateCommand ()` branch,
the result has to be `IO ()`; for the `Get :: StateCommand Int` branch, the
result has to be `IO Int`.

We can also be boring and interpret it using `State Int`:

``` haskell
interpretState :: StateCommand a -> State Int a
interpretState = \case
    Put x -> put x
    Get   -> get

runAsState :: IntState a -> State Int a
runAsState = runPromptM interpretState
```

Basically, an `IntState a` is an abstract representation of a program (as a
Monad), and `interpretIO` and `interpretState` are different ways of
*interpreting* that program, in different monadic contexts. To "run" or
interpret our program in a context, we provide a function
`forall x. StateCommand x -> m x`, which interprets each individual primitive
command.

### Duet Commands

Now let's specify the "primitives" of our program. It'll be useful to separate
out the "memory-based" primitive commands from the "communication-based"
primitive commands. This is so that we can write interpreters that operate on
each one individually, and re-use our memory-based primitives and interpreters
for both parts of the puzzle.

For memory, we can access and modify register values, as well as jump around in
the program tape and read the `Op` at the current program head:

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L57-L61

data Mem :: Type -> Type where
    MGet  :: Char -> Mem Int
    MSet  :: Char -> Int -> Mem ()
    MJump :: Int  -> Mem ()
    MPeek :: Mem Op
```

For communication, we must be able to "snd" and "rcv".

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L63-L65

data Com :: Type -> Type where
    CSnd :: Int -> Com ()
    CRcv :: Int -> Com Int
```

Part A requires `CRcv` to take, as an argument, a number, since whether or not
`CRcv` is a no-op depends on the value of a certain register for Part A's
virtual machine.

Now, we can leverage the `:|:` type from
*[type-combinators](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/type-combinators)*:

``` haskell
data (f :|: g) a = L (f a)
                 | R (g a)
```

`:|:` is a "functor disjunction" --- a value of type `(f :|: g) a` is either
`f a` or `g a`. `:|:` is in *base* twice, as `:+:` in *GHC.Generics* and as
`Sum` in *Data.Functor.Sum*. However, the version in *type-combinators* has some
nice utility combinators we will be using and is more fully-featured.

We can use `:|:` to create the type `Mem :|: Com`. If `Mem` and `Com` represent
"primitives" in our Duet language, then `Mem :|: Com` represents *primitives
from either `Mem` or `Com`*. It's a type that contains all of the primitives of
`Mem` and the primitives of `Com`. It contains:

``` haskell
L (MGet 'c') :: (Mem :|: Com) Int
L MPeek      :: (Mem :|: Com) Op
R (CSnd 5)   :: (Mem :|: Com) ()
```

etc.

Our final data monad, then --- a monad that encompasses *all* possible Duet
primitive commands --- is:

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L67-L67

type Duet = Program (Mem :|: Com)
```

We can write some convenient utility primitives to make things easier for us in
the long run:

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L69-L85

dGet :: Char -> Duet Int
dGet = singleton . L . MGet

dSet :: Char -> Int -> Duet ()
dSet r = singleton . L . MSet r

dJump :: Int -> Duet ()
dJump = singleton . L . MJump

dPeek :: Duet Op
dPeek = singleton (L MPeek)

dSnd :: Int -> Duet ()
dSnd = singleton . R . CSnd

dRcv :: Int -> Duet Int
dRcv = singleton . R . CRcv
```

### Constructing Duet Programs

Armed with our `Duet` monad, we can now write a real-life `Duet` action to
represent *one step* of our duet programs:

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L87-L110

stepProg :: Duet ()
stepProg = dPeek >>= \case
    OSnd x -> do
      dSnd =<< addrVal x
      dJump 1
    OBin f x y -> do
      yVal <- addrVal y
      xVal <- dGet    x
      dSet x $ f xVal yVal
      dJump 1
    ORcv x -> do
      y <- dRcv =<< dGet x
      dSet x y
      dJump 1
    OJgz x y -> do
      xVal <- addrVal x
      dJump =<< if xVal > 0
        then addrVal y
        else return 1
  where
    -- | Addr is `Either Char Int` -- `Left` means a register (so we use
    -- `dGet`) and `Right` means a direct integer value.
    addrVal (Left r ) = dGet r
    addrVal (Right x) = return x
```

This is basically a straightforward interpretation of the "rules" of our
language, and what to do when encountering each op code.

The only non-trivial thing is the `ORcv` branch, where we include the contents
of the register in question, so that our interpreter will know whether or not to
treat it as a no-op.

## The Interpreters

Now for the fun part!

### Interpreting Memory Primitives

To interpret our `Mem` primitives, we need to be in some sort of stateful monad
that contains the program state. First, let's make a type describing our
relevant program state, along with classy lenses for operating on it
polymorphically:

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L112-L116

data ProgState = PS
    { _psOps  :: P.PointedList Op
    , _psRegs :: M.Map Char Int
    }
makeClassy ''ProgState
```

We store the current program and program head with the `PointedList`, and also
represent the register contents with a `Map Char Int`.

#### Brief Aside on Lenses with State

We're going to be implementing our interpreters using
*[lens](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens)* machinery. Keep in mind that
this isn't necessary --- to me, this just makes things a lot simpler. Using
*lens* with classy lenses is one of the things that make programming against
`State` and `MonadState` with non-trivial state bearable for me, personally!
However, keep in mind that the lens aspect is more or less unrelated to the
interpreter pattern and is not necessary for it. We're just using it here to
make `State` and `MonadState` a little nicer to work with!

`makeClassy` gives us a typeclass `HasProgState`, which is for things that
"have" a `ProgState`, as well as lenses into the `psOps` and `psRegs` field for
that type:

``` haskell
psOps  :: HasProgState s => Lens' s (P.PointedList Op)
psRegs :: HasProgState s => Lens' s (M.Map Char Int)
```

We can use these lenses with *lens* library functions for working with State:

``` haskell
-- | "get" based on a lens
use   :: MonadState s m => Lens' s a -> m a

-- | "set" through on a lens
(.=)  :: MonadState s m => Lens' s a -> a -> m ()

-- | "lift" a State action through a lens
zoom  :: Lens' s t -> State t a -> State s a
```

So, for example, we have:

``` haskell
-- | "get" the registers
use psRegs :: (HasProgState s, MonadState s m) => m (M.Map Char Int)

-- | "set" the PointedList
(psOps .=) :: (HasProgState s, MonadState s m) => P.PointedList Op -> m ()
```

The nice thing about lenses is that they compose. For example, we have:

``` haskell
at :: k -> Lens' (Map k    v  ) (Maybe v  )

at 'h'  :: Lens' (Map Char Int) (Maybe Int)
```

We can use `at 'c'` to give us a lens from our registers (`Map Char Int`) into
the specific register `'c'` as a `Maybe Int` --- it's `Nothing` if the item is
not in the `Map`, and `Just` if it is (with the value).

However, we want to treat all registers as `0` by default, not as `Nothing`, so
we can use `non 0`:

``` haskell
non 0 :: Lens' (Maybe Int) Int
```

`non 0` is a `Lens` (actually an `Iso`, but who's counting?) into a `Maybe Int`
to treat `Nothing` as if it was `0`, and to treat `Just x` as if it was `x`.

We can chain `at r` with `non 0` to get a lens into a `Map Char Int`, which we
can use to edit a specific item, treating non-present-items as 0.

``` haskell
         at 'h' . non 0 :: Lens' (Map Char Int) Int

psRegs . at 'h' . non 0 :: HasProgState s => Lens' s Int
```

#### Interpreting Mem

With these tools to make life easier, we can write an interpreter for our `Mem`
commands:

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L118-L128

interpMem
    :: (MonadState s m, MonadFail m, HasProgState s)
    => Mem a
    -> m a
interpMem = \case
    MGet c   -> use (psRegs . at c . non 0)
    MSet c x -> psRegs . at c . non 0 .= x
    MJump n  -> do
      Just t' <- P.moveN n <$> use psOps
      psOps .= t'
    MPeek    -> use (psOps . P.focus)
```

Nothing too surprising here --- we just interpret every primitive in our monadic
context.

We use `MonadFail` to explicitly state that we rely on a failed pattern match
for control flow.[^2]
`P.moveN :: Int -> P.PointedList a -> Maybe (P.PointedList a)` will "shift" a
`PointedList` by a given amount, but will return `Nothing` if it goes out of
bounds. Our program is meant to terminate if we ever go out of bounds, so we can
implement this by using a do block pattern match with `MonadFail`. For instances
like `MaybeT`/`Maybe`, this means `empty`/`Nothing`/short-circuit. So when we
`P.move`, we do-block pattern match on `Just t'`.

We also use `P.focus :: Lens' (P.PointedList a) a`, a lens that the
*pointedlist* library provides to the current "focus" of the `PointedList`.

Again, this usage of lens with State is not exactly necessary (we can manually
use `modify`, `gets`, etc. instead of lenses and their combinators, which gets
ugly pretty quickly), but it does make things a bit more convenient to write.

We're programming against *abstract interfaces* (like `MonadState`, `MonadFail`)
instead of actual instances (like `StateT`, etc.) because, as we will see later,
this lets us combine interpreters together much more smoothly.

#### GADT Property

Again, the GADT-ness of `Mem` (and `Com`) works to enforce that the "results"
that each primitive expects is the result that we give.

For example, `MGet 'c' :: Mem Int` requires us to return `m Int`. This is what
`use` gives us. `MSet 'c' 3 :: Mem ()` requires us to return `m ()`, which is
what `(.=)` returns.

We have `MPeek :: Mem Op`, which requires us to return `m Op`. That's exactly
what `use (psOps . P.focus) :: (MonadState s m, HasProgState s) => m Op` gives.

The fact that we can use GADTs to specify the "result type" of each of our
primitives is a key part about how `Program` from *operational* works, and how
it implements the interpreter pattern.

This is enforced in Haskell's type system (through the "dependent pattern
match"), so GHC will complain to us if we ever return something of the wrong
type while handling a given constructor/primitive.

### Interpreting Com for Part A

Now, Part A requires an environment where:

1.  `CSnd` "emits" items (as sounds), keeping track only of the *last* emitted
    item
2.  `CRcv` "catches" the last thing seen by `CSnd`, keeping track of only the
    *first* caught item

We can keep track of this using `MonadWriter (First Int)` to interpret `CRcv`
(if there are two *rcv*'s, we only care about the first *rcv*'d thing), and
`MonadAccum (Last Int)` to interpret `CSnd`. A `MonadAccum` is just like
`MonadWriter` (where you can "tell" things and accumulate things), but you also
have the ability to read the accumulated log at any time. We use `Last Int`
because, if there are two *snd*'s, we only care about the last *snd*'d thing.

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L134-L145

interpComA
    :: (MonadAccum (Last Int) m, MonadWriter (First Int) m)
    => Com a
    -> m a
interpComA = \case
    CSnd x ->
      add (Last (Just x))
    CRcv x -> do
      unless (x == 0) $ do      -- don't rcv if the register parameter is 0
        Last lastSent <- look
        tell (First lastSent)
      return x
```

Note `add :: MonadAccum w m => w -> m ()` and `look :: MonadAccum w w`, the
functions to "tell" to a `MonadAccum` and the function to "get"/"ask" from a
`MonadAccum`.

#### MonadAccum

Small relevant note --- `MonadAccum` does not yet exist in *mtl*, though it
probably will in the next version. It's the classy version of `AccumT`, which is
already in
*[transformers-0.5.5.0](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-0.5.5.0)*.

For now, [I've added
`MonadAccum`](https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L130-L132)
and [appropriate
instances](https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L249-L251)
in the sample source code, but when the new version of *mtl* comes out, I'll be
sure to update this post to take this into account!

### Interpreting Com for Part B

Part B requires an environment where:

1.  `CSnd` "emits" items into into some accumulating log of items, and we need
    to keep track of all of them.
2.  `CRcv` "consumes" items from some external environment, and fails when there
    are no more items to consume.

We can interpret `CSnd`'s effects using `MonadWriter [Int]`, to collect all
emitted `Int`s. We can interpret `CRcv`'s effects using `MonadState s`, where
`s` contains an `[Int]` acting as a source of `Int`s to consume.

We're going to use a `Thread` type to keep track of all thread state. We do this
so we can merge the contexts of `interpMem` and `interpComB`, and really treat
them (using type inference) as both working in the same interpretation context.

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L158-L165

data Thread = T
    { _tState   :: ProgState
    , _tBuffer  :: [Int]
    }
makeClassy ''Thread

instance HasProgState Thread where
    progState = tState
```

(We write an instance for `HasProgState Thread`, so we can use `interpMem` in a
`MonadState Thread m`, since `psRegs :: Lens' Thread (M.Map Char Int)`, for
example, will refer to the `psRegs` inside the `ProgState` in the `Thread`)

And now, to interpret:

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L167-L176

interpComB
    :: (MonadWriter [Int] m, MonadFail m, MonadState Thread m)
    => Com a
    -> m a
interpComB = \case
    CSnd x -> tell [x]
    CRcv _ -> do
      x:xs <- use tBuffer
      tBuffer .= xs
      return x
```

Note again the usage of do block pattern matches and `MonadFail`.

### Combining Interpreters

To combine interpreters, we're going to be using, from *type-combinators*:

``` haskell
(>|<) :: (f a -> r)
      -> (g a -> r)
      -> ((f :|: g) a -> r)
```

Basically, `>|<` lets us write a "handler" for a `:|:` by providing a handler
for each side. For example, with more concrete types:

``` haskell
(>|<) :: (Mem a           -> r)
      -> (Com a           -> r)
      -> ((Mem :|: Com) a -> r)
```

We can use this to build an interpreter for `Duet`, which goes into
`interpretWithMonad`, by using `>|<` to generate our compound interpreters.

``` haskell
interpretWithMonad
    :: Monad m
    => (forall x. (Mem x :|: Com x) -> m x)
    -> Duet a
    -> m a
```

This is how we can create interpreters on `Duet` by "combining", in a modular
way, interpreters for `Mem` and `Com`. This is the essence of the "data types a
la carte" technique and the modular interpreter pattern.

## Getting the Results

We now just have to pick concrete monads now for us to interpret into.

### Part A

Our interpreter for Part A is `interpMem >|< interpComA` --- we interpret the
`Mem` primitives the usual way, and interpret the `Com` primitives the Part A
way.

Let's check what capabilities our interpreter must have:

``` haskell
ghci> :t interpMem >|< interpComA
interpMem >|< interpComA
    :: ( MonadWriter (First Int) m
       , MonadAccum (Last Int) m
       , MonadFail m
       , MonadState s m
       , HasProgState s
       )
    => (Mem :|: Com) a
    -> m a
```

So it looks like we need to be `MonadWriter (First Int)`,
`MonadAccum (Last Int)`, `MonadFail m`, and `MonadState s m`, where
`HasProgState s`.

Now, we can write such a Monad from scratch, or we can use the *transformers*
library to generate a transformer with all of those instances for us. For the
sake of brevity and reducing duplicated code, let's take the latter route. We
can use:

``` haskell
MaybeT (StateT ProgState (WriterT (First Int) (Accum (Last Int))))
```

And so we can write our final "step" function in that context:

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L147-L148

stepA :: MaybeT (StateT ProgState (WriterT (First Int) (A.Accum (Last Int)))) ()
stepA = interpretWithMonad (interpMem >|< interpComA) stepProg
```

`stepA` will make a single step of the tape, according to the interpreters
`interpMem` and `interpComA`.

Our final answer is then just the result of *repeating* this over and over again
until there's a failure (we jump out-of-bounds). We take advantage of the fact
that `MaybeT`'s `Alternative` instance uses `empty` for `fail`, so we can use
`many :: MaybeT m a -> MaybeT m [a]`, which repeats a `MaybeT` action several
times until a failure is encountered. In our case, this means we repeat until we
jump out of bounds.

As a nice benefit of laziness, note that if we only want the value of the
`First Int` in the `WriterT`, this will actually only repeat `stepA` until the
*first* valid `CRcv` uses `tell`. If we only ask for the `First Int`, it'll stop
running the rest of the computation, bypassing `many`!

Here is the entirety of running Part A --- as you can see, it consists mostly of
unwrapping *transformers* newtype wrappers.

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L150-L156

partA :: P.PointedList Op -> Maybe Int
partA ops = getFirst
          . flip A.evalAccum mempty
          . execWriterT
          . flip runStateT (PS ops M.empty)
          . runMaybeT
          $ many stepA
```

A `Nothing` result means that the `Writer` log never received any outputs before
`many` ends looping, which means that the tape goes out of bounds before a
successful *rcv*.

### Part B

Our interpreter's type for Part B is a little simpler:

``` haskell
ghci> :t interpMem >|< interpComB
interpMem >|< interpComB
    :: ( MonadWriter [Int] m
       , MonadFail m
       , MonadState Thread m
       )
    => (Mem :|: Com) a
    -> m a
```

We can really just use:

``` haskell
WriterT [Int] (MaybeT (State Thread))
```

Writing our concrete `stepB` is a little more involved, since we have to juggle
the state of each thread separately. We can do this using:

``` haskell
zoom _1 :: MaybeT (State s) a -> MaybeT (State (s, t)) a
zoom _2 :: MaybeT (State t) a -> MaybeT (State (s, t)) a
```

To "lift" our actions on one thread to be actions on a "tuple" of threads. We
have, in the end:

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L178-L187

stepB :: MaybeT (State (Thread, Thread)) Int
stepB = do
    outA <- execWriterT . zoom _1 $
      many $ interpretWithMonad (interpMem >|< interpComB) stepProg
    outB <- execWriterT . zoom _2 $
      many $ interpretWithMonad (interpMem >|< interpComB) stepProg
    _1 . tBuffer .= outB
    _2 . tBuffer .= outA
    guard . not $ null outA && null outB
    return $ length outB
```

Our final `stepB` really doesn't need the `WriterT [Int]` --- we just need that
internally to collect *snd* outputs. So we use `execWriter` after "interpreting"
our actions (along with `many`, to repeat our thread steps until they block) to
just get the resulting logs immediately.

We then reset the input buffers appropriately (by putting in the collected
outputs of the previous threads).

If both threads are blocking (they both have to external outputs to pass on),
then we're done (using `guard`, which acts as a "immediately fail here" action
for `MaybeT`).

We return the number of items that "Program 1" (the second thread) outputs,
because that's what we need for our answer.

This is one "single pass" of both of our threads. As you probably guessed, we'll
use `many` again to run these multiple times until both threads block.

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L189-L197

partB :: P.PointedList Op -> Int
partB ops = maybe (error "`many` cannot fail") sum
          . flip evalState s0
          . runMaybeT
          $ many stepB
  where
    s0 = ( T (PS ops (M.singleton 'p' 0)) []
         , T (PS ops (M.singleton 'p' 1)) []
         )
```

`many :: MaybeT s Int -> MaybeT s [Int]`, so `runMaybeT` gives us a
`Maybe [Int]`, where each item in the resulting list is the number of items
emitted by Program 1 at every iteration of `stepB`. Note that `many` produces an
action that is guaranteed to succeed, so its result *must be `Just`*. To get our
final answer, we only need to sum.

### Examples

In the [sample source
code](https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs),
I've included [my own puzzle
input](https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L204-L247)
provided to me from the advent of code website. We can now get actual answers
given some sample puzzle input:

``` haskell
-- source: https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/duet/Duet.hs#L199-L202

main :: IO ()
main = do
    print $ partA (parseProgram testProg)
    print $ partB (parseProgram testProg)
```

And, as a stack script, we can run this and see my own puzzle input's answers:

``` bash
$ ./Duet.hs
Just 7071
8001
```

## Wrap Up

That's it! Hope you enjoyed some of the techniques used in this post, including
--

1.  Leveraging the interpreter pattern (with *operational*) to create a monad
    that can be interpreted in multiple contexts with multiple different
    interpreters
2.  Using functor disjunctions like `:|:` (or `:+:`, `Sum`, etc.) to combine
    interpretable primitives
3.  Writing modular interpreters for each set of primitives, then using
    deconstructors like `>|<` to easily combine and swap out interpreters.
4.  Lenses with State and classy lenses.
5.  Programming against polymorphic monadic contexts like `MonadState`,
    `MonadWriter`, `MonadAccum`, etc., which helps us combine interpreters in a
    very smooth way.

## Pushing the Boundaries

That's the main part of the post! However, just for fun, we can take things a
little further and expand on this technique. The *type-combinators* library
opens up a lot of doors to combining modular interpreters in more complex ways!

### Functor conjunctions

We see that `:|:` (functor disjunction) can be used to merge sets of primitives.
We can also use `:&:` (functor conjunction), also known as `:*:` from
*Generics.GHC* and `Product` from *Data.Functor.Product*!

``` haskell
newtype (f :&: g) a = f a :&: g a
```

Used with GADTs representing primitives, `:&:` lets us "tag" our primitives with
extra things.

For example, we were pretty sneaky earlier by using `zoom` to manually lift our
`Mem` interpreter to work on specific threads. Instead, we can actually use
`Const Int` to attach a thread ID to `Mem`s:

``` haskell
-- | type-combinators exports its own version of 'Const'
newtype C r a = C { getC :: r }

-- | Peek into Thread 0
C 0 :&: MPeek       :: (C Int :&: Mem) Op

-- | Get contents of register 'c' of Thread 1
C 1 :&: MGet 'c'    :: (C Int :&: Mem) Int
```

The advantage we gain by using these tags is that we now have an approach that
can be generalized to multiple threads, as well.

If we had a version of `interpMem` that takes a thread:

``` haskell
interpMemThread
    :: (MonadState s m, MonadFail m, HasProgState s)
    => C Int a
    -> Mem a
    -> m a
```

we can use the analogy of `>|<`, `uncurryFan`:

``` haskell
uncurryFan
    :: (forall x. f x -> g x -> r)
    -> (f :&: g) a
    -> r

uncurryFan interpMemThread
    :: (MonadState s m, MonadFail m)
    => (C Int :&: Mem) a
    -> m a
```

We can build interpreters of combinations of `:|:` and `:&:` by using
combinations of `>|<` and `uncurryFan`.

``` haskell
interpMem >|< interpComB
    :: ( MonadWriter [Int] m
       , MonadFail m
       , MonadState Thread m
       )
    => (Mem :|: Com) a
    -> m a

uncurryFan interpMemThread >|< interpComB
    :: ( MonadWriter [Int] m
       , MonadFail m
       , MonadState Thread m
       )
    => ((C Int :&: Mem) :|: Com) a
    -> m a
```

### Manipulating Disjunctions and Conjunctions

So, we have a `Mem :|: Com`. How could we "tag" our `Mem` after-the-fact, to add
`C Int`? Well, we can manipulate the structure of conjunctions and disjunctions
using the `Bifunctor1` from *Type.Class.Higher*, in *type-combinators*.

`bimap1` can be used to modify either half of a `:|:` or `:&:`:

``` haskell
bimap1
    :: (forall x. f x -> h x)
    -> (forall x. g x -> j x)
    -> (f :|: g) a
    -> (h :|: j) a

bimap1
    :: (forall x. f x -> h x)
    -> (forall x. g x -> j x)
    -> (f :&: g) a
    -> (h :&: j) a
```

So we can "tag" the `Mem` in `Mem :|: Cmd` using:

``` haskell
bimap1 (C 0 :&:) id
    :: (      Mem       :|: Com) a
    -> ((C Int :&: Mem) :|: Com) a
```

Which we can use to re-tag a `Program (Mem :|: Com)`, with the help of
`interpretWithMonad`:

``` haskell
\f -> interpretWithMonad (singleotn . f)
    :: (forall x. f x -> g x)
    -> Program f a
    -> Program g a

interpretWithMonad (singleton . bimap1 (C 0 :&:) id)
    :: Program (      Mem       :|: Com) a
    -> Program ((C Int :&: Mem) :|: Com) a
```

### Combining many different sets of primitives

If we had three sets of primitives we wanted to combine, we might be tempted to
use `f :|: g :|: h` and `handleF >|< handleG >|< handleH`. However, there's a
better way! Instead of `f :|: g :|: h`, you can use `FSum '[f, g, h]` to combine
multiple sets of primitives in a clean way, using a type-level list.

If there are no duplicates in your type-level list, you can even use `finj` to
create your `FSum`s automatically:

``` haskell
-- (âˆˆ) is a typeclass that has instances whenever f in the type-level list fs
finj :: f âˆˆ fs => f a -> FSum fs a

finj :: Mem a -> FSum '[Mem, Com, Foo] a
finj :: Com a -> FSum '[Mem, Com, Foo] a
finj :: Foo a -> FSum '[Mem, Com, Foo] a

singleton (finj (MGet 'c')) :: Program (FSum '[Mem, Com, Foo]) Int
singleton (finj (CSnd 3  )) :: Program (FSum '[Mem, Com, Foo]) Int
```

There isn't really a nice built-in way to build handlers for these (like we did
earlier using `>|<`), but you can whip up a utility function with `Prod` (from
*type-combinators*) and `ifoldMapFSum`.

``` haskell
newtype Handle a r f = Handle { runHandle :: f a -> r }

handleFSum :: Prod (Handle a r) fs -> FSum fs a -> r
handleFSum hs = ifoldMapFSum $ \i -> runHandle (index i hs)
```

`Prod` lets you bunch up a bunch of handlers together, so you can build handlers
like:

``` haskell
handleMem :: Mem a -> m a
handleCom :: Com a -> m a
handleFoo :: Foo a -> m a

handleFSum (Handle handleMem :< Handle handleCom :< Handle handleFoo :< Ã˜)
    :: FSum '[Mem, Com, Foo] a -> m a

interpretWithMonad
        (handleFSum ( Handle handleMem
                   :< Handle handleCom
                   :< Handle handleFoo
                   :< Ã˜)
        )
    :: Program (FSum '[Mem, Com, Foo]) a -> m a
```

### Endless Possibilities

Hopefully this post inspires you a bit about this fun design pattern! And, if
anything, I hope after reading this, you learn to recognize situations where
this *modular* interpreter pattern might be useful in your everyday programming.

[^1]: You could also use the more-or-less identical

    However, this is not to be confused with the
    [prompt](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/prompt) library, which is
    unrelated! The library is actually my own that I wrote a few years back
    before I knew about MonadPrompt, and this unfortunate naming collision is
    one of my greatest Haskell regrets.

[^2]: Using `MonadFail` in situations were we would normally use
    `Alternative`/`MonadPlus`, to take advantage of pattern match syntax in do
    block and have it work with `Alternative` combinators like `many`, is
    [coming](https://wiki.haskell.org/MonadFail_Proposal)! For good hygiene,
    remember to turn on the *-XMonadFailDesugaring* extension so that pattern
    match failures explicitly use `fail` from `MonadFail`, thus requiring the
    typeclass constraint.
