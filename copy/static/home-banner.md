[Justin Le][about]
------------------

Welcome!  My name is Justin Le.  I'm an Applied Math/Computational Science PhD
with a background with physics, previously at [Chapman University][],
[SimSpace][], [Google][], and currently at [Anduril][]. This is just my weblog
covering my various adventures in programming and explorations in the vast
worlds of computation, physics, engineering, mathematics, and knowledge. Expect
a healthy curiosity and an only slightly unhealthy obsession for finding new
ways to marvel, wonder, and create.  Join me if you wish!
