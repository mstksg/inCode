Welcome back to our journey through the singleton design pattern and the
great *[singletons][]* library!

[singletons]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons

This post is a direct continuation of [Part 1][], so be sure to check that out
first if you haven't already!  If you hare just jumping in now, I suggest
taking some time to to through the exercises if you haven't already!

[Part 1]: https://blog.jle.im/entry/introduction-to-singletons-1.html

Again, code is built on *GHC 8.6.1* with the *[nightly-2018-09-29][snapshot]*
snapshot (so, singletons-2.5).  All of the code is also available
[here][source], and you can drop into a ghci session with all of the bindings
in scope by executing the file:

$ ./Door2.hs
```

Review
------

Let's return to our `Door` type:

```haskell
!!!singletons/Door2.hs "$(singletons " "data Door "
```

First, this derives the *type* `DoorState` with the values `Opened`, `Closed`,
and `Locked`, and also the *kind* `DoorState` with the *types* `'Opened`,
`'Closed`, and `'Locked`.  We then also derive the singletons (and
implicit-style typeclass instances, reflectors, etc.) with the template
haskell.

Then, there's `Door`.  `Door` is great!  It is an *indexed data type* (indexed
by a type of kind `DoorState`) in that picking a different type variable gives
a different "type" of Door:

*   `Door 'Opened` is a type that represents the type of an opened door
*   `Door 'Closed` is a *different* type that represents the type of a *closed*
    door
*   `Door 'Locked` is yet another (third) type that represents the type of a
    *locked* door.

So, really, when we define `Door s`, we really are defining *three distinct*
types[^fourth].

[^fourth]: And also a not-so-obvious fourth type, `forall s. Door s`, which is
a subtype of all of those three!

This is great and all, but isn't Haskell a language with static, compile-time
types?  Doesn't that mean that we have to know if our doors are opened, closed,
or locked at compile-time?

This is something we can foresee being a big issue.  It's easy enough to create
a `Door s` if you know `s` at compile-time by just typing in a type annotation
(`UnsafeMkDoor "Oak" :: Door 'Opened`) or by using a monomorphic constructor
(`mkDoor @SOpened "Oak"`).  But what if we *don't* know `s` at compile-time?

To learn how to do this, we first need to learn how to *not care*.

Ditching the Phantom
--------------------

Sometimes we don't *actually* care about the state of the door in the *type* of
the door.  We don't want `Door 'Opened` and `Door 'Closed`...we want a type to
just represent a door, without the status in its type.

This might come about a bunch of different ways.  Maybe you're reading a `Door`
data from a serialization format, and you want to be able to parse *any* door
(whatever door is serialized).

To learn how to not care, we can describe a type for a door that does *not*
have its status in its type.

We have a couple of options here.  First, we can create a new type `SomeDoor`
that is the same as `Door`, except instead of keeping its status in its type,
it keeps it as a runtime value:

```haskell
data SomeDoor = MkSomeDoor
    { someDoorState    :: DoorState
    , someDoorMaterial :: String
    }

-- or, in GADT syntax
data SomeDoor :: Type where
    MkSomeDoor ::
      { someDoorState    :: DoorState
      , someDoorMaterial :: String
      } -> SomeDoor
```

Note the similarity of `SomeDoor`'s declaration to `Door`'s declaration above.
It's mostly the same, except, instead of `DoorState` being a type parameter, it
is instead a runtime value inside `SomeDoor`.

Now, this is actually a type that we *could* have been using this entire time,
if we didn't care about type safety.  In the real world and in real
applications, we actually might have written `SomeDoor` *before* we ever
thought about `Door` with a phantom type.  It's definitely the more typical
"standard" Haskell thing.

`SomeDoor` is great.  But because it's a completely different type, we can't
re-use any of our `Door` functions on this `SomeDoor`.  We potentially have to
write the same function twice for both `Door` and `SomeDoor`, because they have
different implementations.

### The Existential Datatype

However, there's another path we can take.  With the power of singletons, we
can actually implement `SomeDoor` *in terms of* `Door`, using an **existential
data type**:

```haskell
-- using existential constructor syntax
data SomeDoor = forall s. MkSomeDoor (Sing s) (Door s)

-- or, using GADT syntax (preferred)
!!!singletons/Door2.hs "data SomeDoor ::"
```

`MkSomeDoor` is a constructor for an existential data type, meaning that the
data type "hides" a type variable `s`.  Note the type (`Sing s -> Door s ->
SomeDoor`) and how the result type (`SomeDoor`) *forgets* the `s` and hides all
traces of it.  Think of it like a type variable sponge -- type variable goes
in, but it's absorbed opaquely into the result type.

Note the similarities between our original `SomeDoor` and this one.

```haskell
-- | Re-implementing door
data SomeDoor where
    MkSomeDoor :: DoorState -> String -> SomeDoor

-- | Re-using Door, as an existential type
data SomeDoor where
    MkSomeDoor  :: Sing s  -> Door s -> SomeDoor
                            -- ^ data Door s = UnsafeMkDoor String
```

Basically, our type before re-implements `Door`.  But the new one actually
directly uses the original `Door s`.  This means we can *directly* re-use our
`Door` functions on `SomeDoor`s, without needing to write completely new
implementations.

In Haskell, existential data types are pretty nice, syntactically, to work
with.  Let's write some basic functions to see.  First, a function to "make" a
`SomeDoor` from a `Door`:

```haskell
!!!singletons/Door2.hs "fromDoor ::" "fromDoor_ ::"
```

So that's how we *make* one...how do we *use* it?  Let's port our `Door`
functions to `SomeDoor`, by re-using our pre-existing functions whenever we
can, and *pattern matching* on `MkSomeDoor`:

```haskell
!!!singletons/Door2.hs "closeSomeOpenedDoor ::" "lockAnySomeDoor ::"
```

Using an existential wrapper with a singleton makes this pretty simple -- just
a simple unwrapping and re-wrapping!  Imagine having to re-implement all of
these functions for a completely different type, and having to re-implement all
of our previous `Door` functions.

It's important to remember that the secret ingredient here is the `Sing s` we
store inside `MkSomeDoor` -- it gives our pattern matchers the ability to
deduce the `s` type.  Without it, the `s` would be lost forever.

If `MkSomeDoor` did not have the `Sing`:

```haskell
data SomeDoor where
    MkSomeDoor  :: Door s -> SomeDoor       -- no Sing s ???
```

It would then be impossible to write `closeSomeOpenedDoor` in a way that only
works on opened doors:

```haskell
closeSomeOpenedDoor :: SomeDoor -> Maybe SomeDoor
closeSomeOpenedDoor (MkSomeDoor d) =
            -- is the door opened, closed, or locked?
            -- there's no way to know!
            -- curses, type erasure!
```

### The Link

It's important to remember that our original separate-implementation `SomeDoor`
is, functionally, identical to the new code-reusing `Door`.  All of the
contents are isomorphic with each other, and you could write a function
converting one to the other.  This is because *having an existentially
quantified singleton is the same as having a value of the corresponding type.*
Having an existentially quantified `SingDS s` is *the same as* having a value
of type `DoorState`.

In fact, the *singletons* library gives us a direct existential wrapper:

```haskell
-- from singletons (not the actual definition)
data SomeSing DoorState :: Type where
    SomeSing :: Sing s -> SomeSing DoorState
```

There are three values of type `SomeSing DoorState`:

```haskell
SomeSing SOpened :: SomeSing DoorState
SomeSing SClosed :: SomeSing DoorState
SomeSing SLocked :: SomeSing DoorState
```

A value of type `SomeSing DoorState` (which contains an existentially
quantified `Sing s` -- a `SingDS`) is *the same* as a value of type
`DoorState`.  The two types are identical!  (Or, well, isomorphic.  As a fun
exercise, write out the explicit isomorphism -- the `SomeSing DoorState ->
DoorState` and the `DoorState -> SomeSing DoorState`).

Our new `SomeDoor` containing an existentially quantified `Sing s` is the same
as our first `SomeDoor` containing just a `DoorState`.

#### Why do we sing?

If they're identical, why use a `Sing` or the new `SomeDoor` at all?  Why not
just use a `DoorState` value?

One main reason (besides allowing code-reuse like we did earlier) is that
*using the singleton lets us directly recover the type*.  Essentially, a `Sing
s` not only contains whether it is Opened/Closed/Locked (like a `DoorState`
would), but also it contains it in a way that GHC can use to *bring it all
back* to the type level.

A `forall s. SomeDoor (Sing s) (Door s)` essentially contains `s` *with* `Door
s`.  When you see this, you *should read this as* `forall s. SomeDoor s (Door
s)` (and, indeed, this is similar to how it is written in dependently typed
languages.)

It's kind of like how, when you're used to reading Applicative style, you start
seeing `f <$> x <*> y` and reading it like `f x y`.  When you see `forall s.
SomeDoor (Sing s) (Door s)`, you should read (the pseudo-haskell) `forall s.
SomeDoor s (Door s)`.  The role of `Sing s` there is, like in Part 1, simply to
be a run-time stand-in for the type `s` itself.

So, for our original `Door s` functions, we need to know `s` at runtime --
storing the `Sing s` gives GHC exactly that.  Once you get the `Sing s` back,
you can now use it in all of our type-safe functions from Part 1, and you're
back in type-safe land.[^pos]

[^pos]: You might have noticed I was a bit sneaky by jumping straight
    `SomeDoor` when we already had a perfectly good "I don't care" option.  We
    used it last post!

    ~~~haskell
    lockAnyDoor :: Sing s -> Door s -> Door 'Locked
    ~~~

    This does work!  `lockAnyDoor` takes a `Door s` and doesn't "care" about
    what `s` it gets (it's parametrically polymorphic).

    So, this normal "parametrically polymorphic" way is how we have, in the
    past, treated functions that *can take* a `Door` with an `s` we don't want
    the type system to care about.  However, the reason we need `SomeDoor` and
    existentially quantified types is for the situation where we want to
    *return* something that we want to the type system to not care about.


### Some Lingo

In the language of dependently typed programming, we call `SomeDoor` a
**dependent sum**, because you can imagine it basically as a sum type:

```haskell
data SomeDoor = SDOpened (Door 'Opened)
              | SDClosed (Door 'Closed)
              | SDLocked (Door 'Locked)
```

A three-way sum between a `Door 'Opened`, a `Door 'Closed`, and a `Door
'Locked`, essentially.  If you have a `SomeDoor`, it's *either* an opened door,
a closed door, or a locked door.  Try looking at this new `SomeDoor` until you
realize that this type is the same type as the previous `SomeDoor`!

You might also see `SomeDoor` called a **dependent pair** -- it's a "tuple"
where the *type* of the second item (our `Door s`) is determined by the *value*
of the first item (our `Sing s`).

In Idris, we could write `SomeDoor` as a type alias, using its native
[dependent pair syntactic sugar][dpsug], as `(s ** Door s)`.  The *value* of
the first item reveals to us (through a pattern match, in Haskell) the *type*
of the second.

[dpsug]: http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/typesfuns.html#dependent-pairs

### Types at Runtime

With this new tool, we finally have enough to build a function to "make" a door
with the status unknown until runtime:

```haskell
mkSomeDoor :: DoorState -> String -> SomeDoor
mkSomeDoor = \case
    Opened -> fromDoor_ . mkDoor SOpened
    Closed -> fromDoor_ . mkDoor SClosed
    Locked -> fromDoor_ . mkDoor SLocked
```

```haskell
ghci> let mySomeDoor = mkSomeDoor Opened "Birch"
ghci> :t mySomeDoor
SomeDoor
ghci> putStrLn $ case mySomeDoor of
        MkSomeDoor SOpened _ -> "mySomeDoor was opened!"
        MkSomeDoor SClosed _ -> "mySomeDoor was closed!"
        MkSomeDoor SLocked _ -> "mySomeDoor was locked!"
mySomeDoor was opened!
```

Using `mkSomeDoor`, we can truly pass in a `DoorState` that we generate at
runtime (from IO, or a user prompt, or a configuration file, maybe), and create
a `Door` based on it.

Take *that*, type erasure! :D

### The Existential Type

An *existentially quantified* type is one that is hidden to the user/consumer,
but directly chosen by the producer.  The producer chooses the type, and the
user has to handle any possible type that the producer gave.

This is in direct contrast to the *universally quantified* type (which most
Haskellers are used to seeing), where the type is directly chosen by the
*user*.  The user chooses the type, and the producer has to handle any possible
type that the user asks for.

For example, a function like:

```haskell
read :: Read a => String -> a
```

Is universally quantified over `a`: The *caller* of `read` gets to pick which
type is given.  The burden is on the  implementor of `read` to be able to
handle whatever `a` the user picks.

But, for a value like:

```haskell
myDoor :: SomeDoor
```

The type variable `s` is existentially quantified.  The person who *made*
`myDoor` picked what `s` was.  And, if you *use* `myDoor`, you have to be ready
to handle *any* `s` they could have chosen.

In Haskell, there's another way to express an existentially quantified type:
the CPS-style encoding.  This way is useful because it doesn't require creating
an intermediate helper data type.  To help us understand it, let's compare a
basic function in both styles.  We saw earlier `mkSomeDoor`, which takes a
`DoorState` and a `String` and returns an existentially quantified `Door` in
the form of `SomeDoor`:

```haskell
mkSomeDoor
    :: DoorState
    -> String
    -> SomeDoor
mkSomeDoor s m = case s of
    Opened -> fromDoor_ (mkDoor SOpened m)
    Closed -> fromDoor_ (mkDoor SClosed m)
    Locked -> fromDoor_ (mkDoor SLocked m)
```

The caller of the function can then break open the `SomeDoor` and must handle
whatever `s` they find inside.

We can write the same function using a *CPS-style* existential instead:

```haskell
withDoor
    :: DoorState
    -> String
    -> (forall s. Sing s -> Door s -> r)
    -> r
withDoor s m f = case s of
    Opened -> f SOpened (mkDoor SOpened m)
    Closed -> f SClosed (mkDoor SClosed m)
    Locked -> f SLocked (mkDoor SLocked m)
```

With a Rank-N Type, `withDoor` takes a `DoorState` and a `String` and a
*function to handle a `Door s` polymorphically*.  The caller of `withDoor` must
provide a handler that can handle *any* `s`, in a uniform and parametrically
polymorphic way.  The function then gives the result of the handler function
called on the resulting `Sing s` and `Door s`.

```haskell
ghci> withDoor Opened "Birch" $ \s _ -> case s of
         SOpened -> "Opened door!"
         SClosed -> "Closed door!"
         SLocked -> "Locked door!"
Opened door!
```

The key to making this work is that your handler function *has to be
polymorphic* over all possible `s`s.  This way, it can handle any potential `s`
that the producer gives.  Essentially, the producer is "returning" an `s` --
existentially quantified.

### Reification

The general pattern we are exploring here is called **reification** -- we're
taking a dynamic run-time value, and lifting it to the type level as a type
(here, the type variable `s`).  Reification is often considered as the opposite
of reflection, and we can imagine the two as being the "gateway" between the
type-safe and unsafe world.  In the dynamic world of a `DoorState` term-level
value, you have no type safety.  You live in the world of `SomeDoor`,
`closeSomeOpenedDoor`, `lockAnySomeDoor`, etc.  But, you can *reify* your
`DoorState` value to a *type*, and enter the type-safe world of `Door s`,
`closeDoor`, `lockDoor`, and `lockAnyDoor`.

The *singletons* library automatically generates functions to directly reify
`DoorState` values:

```haskell
toSing       :: DoorState -> SomeSing DoorState
withSomeSing :: DoorState -> (forall s. Sing s        -> r) -> r
withSomeSing :: DoorState -> (forall s. SDoorState s  -> r) -> r
                                     -- ^ using the convenience type synonym
```

The first one reifies a `DoorState` as an existentially quantified data type,
and the second one reifies one in CPS-style, without the intermediate data
type.

We can actually use these to write `mkSomeDoor` and `withDoor` in a nicer way,
without directly pattern matching on our constructors:

```haskell
!!!singletons/Door2.hs "mkSomeDoor ::" "withDoor ::"
```

Zooming Out
-----------

Alright!  We've spent two blog posts going over a lot of different things in
the context of our humble `Door s` type.  Let's zoom out and take a large-scale
look at how *singletons* (the design pattern, and the library) helps us in
general.

### Sing

The crux of everything is the `Sing :: Type -> Type` indexed type.  If you see
a value of type `Sing s`, you should really just think "a runtime witness for
`s`".  If you see:

```haskell
lockAnyDoor :: Sing s -> Door s -> Door 'Locked
MkSomeDoor  :: Sing s -> Door s -> SomeDoor
```

You should read it as (in pseudo-Haskell)

```haskell
lockAnyDoor :: { s } -> Door s -> Door 'Locked
MkSomeDoor  :: { s } -> Door s -> SomeDoor
```

This is seen clearly if we look at the partially applied type signatures:

```haskell
lockAnyDoor SOpened :: Door 'Opened -> Door 'Locked
MkSomeDoor  SLocked :: Door 'Locked -> SomeDoor
```

If you squint, this kinda looks like:

```haskell
lockAnyDoor 'Opened :: Door 'Opened -> Door 'Locked
MkSomeDoor  'Locked :: Door 'Locked -> SomeDoor
```

And indeed, when we get real dependent types in Haskell, we will really be
directly passing types (that act as their own runtime values) instead of
singletons.

It is important to remember that `Sing` is poly-kinded, so we can have `Sing
'Opened`, but also `Sing 'True`, `Sing 5`, and `Sing '['Just 3, 'Nothing, 'Just
0]` as well.  This is the real benefit of using the *singletons* library
instead of writing our own singletons -- we get to work uniformly with
singletons of all kinds.

#### SingI

`SingI` is a bit of typeclass trickery that lets us implicitly pass `Sing`s to
functions:

```haskell
class SingI s where
    sing :: Sing s
```

If you see:

```haskell
lockAnyDoor :: Sing  s -> Door s -> Door 'Locked
fromDoor    :: Sing  s -> Door s -> SomeDoor
```

These are *identical in power* to

```haskell
lockAnyDoor :: SingI s => Door s -> Door 'Locked
fromDoor    :: SingI s => Door s -> SomeDoor
```

Either way, you're passing in the ability to get a runtime witness on `s` --
just in one way, it is asked for as an explicit argument, and the second way,
it is passed in using a typeclass.

We can *convert* from `SingI s ->` style to `SingI s =>` style using `sing`:

```haskell
!!!singletons/Door2.hs "lockAnyDoor_ ::" "fromDoor_ ::"
```

And we can convert from `SingI s =>` style to `SingI s ->` style using
`withSingI`:

```haskell
lockAnyDoor :: Sing s -> Door s -> Door 'Locked
lockAnyDoor s d = withSingI s (lockAnyDoor_ d)

fromDoor :: Sing s -> Door s -> SomeDoor
fromDoor s d = withSingI s (fromDoor_ d)
```

Again, the same function -- just two different styles of calling them.

Here's a nice trick to make this a little more clean:  *singletons-2.4* offers
a nice pattern synonym `Sing` to reflect this symmetry. The pattern `Sing ::
SingI a => Sing a` acts both as a constructor and a witness for `SingI` and
`Sing`:

```haskell
doorStatus_ :: SingI s => Door s -> DoorState
doorStatus_ = doorStatus Sing           -- using Sing constructs the Sing s

lockAnyDoor_ :: SingI s => Door s -> Door 'Locked
lockAnyDoor_ = lockAnyDoor Sing         -- using Sing constructs the Sing s

lockAnyDoor :: Sing s -> Door s -> Door 'Locked
lockAnyDoor Sing d = lockAnyDoor_ d     -- matching on Sing introduces SingI s

fromDoor :: Sing s -> Door s -> SomeDoor
fromDoor Sing d = fromDoor_ d           -- matching on Sing introduces SingI s
```

### Reflection and Reification

Reflection is the process of bringing a type-level thing to a value at the term
level ("losing" the type information in the process) and reification is the
process of bringing a value at the *term level* to the *type level*.

Reflection and reification can be thought of as the gateways between the
untyped/unsafe world and the typed/safe world.  Reflection takes you from the
typed world to the untyped world (from `Sing s` to `DoorState`) and reification
takes you from the untyped world to the typed world (from `DoorState` to `Sing
s`).

One limitation in Haskell is that there is no actual link between the type
`DoorState` and its *values* with the *kind* `DoorState` with its *types*.
Sure, the constructors have the same names, but the language doesn't actually
link them together for us.

#### SingKind

The *singletons* library handles this by using a typeclass with associated
types to implement a generalized reflection and reification process.  It gives
us the `SingKind` "kindclass":

```haskell
class SingKind k where      -- `k` is a kind!
    -- | Associate a kind k with its reflected type
    type Demote k = (r :: Type)

    -- | Reflect a singleton to its term-level value
    fromSing :: Sing (a :: k) -> Demote k

    -- | Reify a term-level value to the type level, as an existentially
    -- quantified singleton
    toSing :: Demote k -> SomeSing k
```

Instances of `SingKind` are (promoted) *kinds* like `Bool`-the-kind,
`DoorState`-the-kind, etc., and `Demote` is an associated type/type family that
associates each instance with the *type* it is promoted from.  (Note -- writing
these type signatures requires the `-XTypeInType` extension, which lets us
treat kinds as types)

For example, remember how `data DoorState = Opened | Closed | Locked` created
the *type* `DoorState` (with value constructors `Opened`, `Closed`, and
`Locked`), and also the *kind* `DoorState` (with *type* constructors `'Opened`,
`'Closed`, and `'Locked`).  Our *kind* `DoorState` would be the instance of
`SingKind`, and `Demote DoorState` would be the *type* `DoorState`.

The reason we need an explicit `Demote` associated type is, again, that GHC
doesn't actually link the type and its promoted kind.  `Demote` lets us
explicitly specify what type a `Kind` should expect its term-level reflected
values to be. (And, like most things in this post, `Demote` will hopefully one
day become obsolete, along with the rest of `SingKind`)

#### Examples

To illustrate explicitly, here is the automatically generated instance of
`SingKind` for the `DoorState` *kind*:

```haskell
instance SingKind DoorState where       -- the *kind* DoorState
    type Demote DoorState = DoorState   -- the *type* DoorState

    fromSing
        :: Sing (s :: DoorState)        -- the *kind* DoorState
        -> DoorState                    -- the *type* DoorState
    fromSing = \case
        SOpened -> Opened
        SClosed -> Closed
        SLocked -> Locked

    toSing
        :: DoorState                    -- the *type* DoorState
        -> SomeSing DoorState           -- the *kind* DoorState
    toSing = \case
        Opened -> SomeSing SOpened
        Closed -> SomeSing SClosed
        Locked -> SomeSing SLocked
```

If you are unfamiliar with how associated types work, `type Demote DoorState =
DoorState` means that wherever we see `Demote DoorState` (with `DoorState` the
*kind*), we replace it with `DoorState` (the *type*).  That's why the type of
our reflection function `fromSing :: Sing s -> Demote DoorState` can be
simplified to `fromSing :: Sing s -> DoorState`.

Let's take a look at the instance for `Bool`, to compare:

```haskell
-- Bool singletons have two constructors:
SFalse :: Sing 'False
STrue  :: Sing 'True

instance SingKind Bool where    -- the *kind* Bool
    type Demote Bool = Bool     -- the *type* Bool

    fromSing
        :: Sing (b :: Bool)        -- the *kind* Bool
        -> Bool                    -- the *type* Bool
    fromSing = \case
        SFalse -> False
        STrue  -> True

    toSing
        :: Bool                    -- the *type* Bool
        -> SomeSing Bool           -- the *kind* Bool
    toSing = \case
        False -> SomeSing SFalse
        True  -> SomeSing STrue
```

And a more sophisticated example, let's look at the instance for `Maybe`:

```haskell
-- Maybe singletons have two constructors:
SNothing :: Sing 'Nothing
SJust    :: Sing x -> Sing ('Just x)

instance SingKind k => SingKind (Maybe k) where     -- the *kind* Maybe
    type Demote (Maybe k) = Maybe (Demote k)        -- the *type* Maybe

    fromSing
        :: Sing (m :: Maybe k)        -- the *kind* Maybe
        -> Maybe (Demote k)           -- the *type* Maybe
    fromSing = \case
        SNothing -> Nothing
        SJust sx -> Just (fromSing sx)

    toSing
        :: Maybe (Demote k)             -- the *type* Maybe
        -> SomeSing (Maybe k)           -- the *kind* Maybe
    toSing = \case
        Nothing -> SomeSing SNothing
        Just x  -> case toSing x of
          SomeSing sx -> SomeSing (SJust sx)
```

This definition, I think, is a real testament to the usefulness of having all
of our singletons be unified under the same system.  Because of how `SingKind`
works, `Demote (Maybe DoorState)` is evaluated to `Maybe (Demote DoorState)`,
which is simplified to `Maybe DoorState`.  This means that if we have a way to
reify `DoorState` values, we also have a way to reify `Maybe DoorState` values!
And, if we have a way to reflect `DoorState` singletons, we also have a way to
reflect `Maybe DoorState` singletons!

#### SomeSing

Throughout all of this, we utilize `SomeSing` as a generic poly-kinded
existential wrapper:

```haskell
data SomeSing :: Type -> Type where
    SomeSing :: Sing (x :: k) -> SomeSing k
```

Basically, this says that `SomeSing k` contains a `Sing x`, where `x` is of
kind `k`.  This is why we had, earlier:

```haskell
SomeSing :: Sing (s :: DoorState) -> SomeSing DoorState
SomeSing :: Sing (s :: Bool)      -> SomeSing Bool
SomeSing :: Sing (s :: Maybe k)   -> SomeSing (Maybe k)
```

If we use `SomeSing` with, say, `SClosed`, we get `SomeSing :: Sing 'Closed ->
SomeSing DoorState`.  `SomeSing` is an indexed type that tells us the *kind* of
the type variable we existentially quantifying over.  The value `SomeSing
STrue` would have the type `SomeSing Bool`.  The value `SomeSing (SJust
SClosed)` would have the type `SomeSing (Maybe DoorState)`.

And, like for `SomeDoor`, it is important to remember that `SomeSing a`, for
kind `a`, is *isomorphic* to the type `a`.  This isomorphism is witnessed by
`fromSing` and `toSing`, but here's, visually, how things match up for
`DoorState`:

```haskell
Opened   <~>    SomeSing SOpened
Closed   <~>    SomeSing SClosed
Locked   <~>    SomeSing SLocked
```

And how they match up for `Maybe Bool`:

```haskell
Nothing      <~>  SomeSing SNothing
Just False   <~>  SomeSing (SJust SFalse)
Just True    <~>  SomeSing (SJust STrue)
```

Looking Forward
---------------

Between these first two parts, we explored a specific use case that would
benefit from dependent types (simple phantom types for state transitions) and
explored how the *singletons* and design pattern help us implement the
functionality necessary to make things useful, and snuck in some concepts from
dependently typed programming as well.  We then took a step back to explore the
*singletons* library in a more "universal" way, and saw how it is generalized
to many different types.

The code is available [here][samples] for you to play around with yourself!

!!![samples]:singletons/Door2.hs

Now that the basics are out of the way, in Part 3 we'll jump deep into
type-level programming and being able to lift our term-level functions on
values up to become type-level functions, and how to use this to express
complex relationships and enhance our code!

Let me know in the comments if you have any questions!  I'm also usually idling
on the freenode `#haskell` channel, as well, as *jle\`*.

And, again, I definitely recommend checking out the [original singletons
paper][paper] for a really nice technical overview of all of these techniques
from the source itself.

### Exercises

Check out the [sample code][samples] for solutions!

1.  Let's revisit our original redundant `SomeDoor`, compared to our final
    `SomeDoor`:

    ```haskell
    !!!singletons/Door2.hs "data OldSomeDoor ::" "data SomeDoor ::"
    ```

    To help convince yourself that the two are equal, write functions
    converting between the two:

    ```haskell
    !!!singletons/Door2.hs "toOld ::"1 "fromOld ::"1
    ```

    **Avoid directly pattern matching on the singletons or constructors**.
    Instead, use *singletons* library tools like `toSing`, `withSomeSing`,
    `fromSing`, etc.

2.  Previously, we had an `unlockDoor` function that took an `Int` (the
    "password") with a `Door 'Locked` and returned a `Maybe (Door 'Closed)`.
    It returns a `Door 'Closed` (unlocked door) in `Just` if an odd number was
    given, and `Nothing` otherwise (a failed unlock)

    Use this to implement a that would return a `SomeDoor`.  Re-use the
    "password" logic from the original `unlockDoor`.  If the door is
    successfully unlocked (with a `Just`), return the unlocked door in a
    `SomeDoor`.  Otherwise, *return the original locked door* (in a
    `SomeDoor`).

    ```haskell
    !!!singletons/Door2.hs "unlockDoor ::" "unlockSomeDoor ::"1
    unlockSomeDoor = ???
    ```

3.  Implement `openAnyDoor'` in the same style, with respect to `openAnyDoor`:

    ```haskell
    !!!singletons/Door2.hs "openAnyDoor ::" "openAnySomeDoor ::"1
    openAnySomeDoor = ???
    ```

    Remember to re-use `openAnyDoor`.

4.  Write the `SingKind` instance for the promoted kind of a custom list
    type:


    ```haskell
    !!!singletons/Door2.hs "data List a" "data instance Sing (x :: List k)" "instance SingKind k => SingKind (List k)"1
        type Demote (List k) = ???

        fromSing :: Sing (xs :: List k) -> List (Demote k)
        fromSing = ???

        toSing :: List (Demote k) -> SomeSing (List k)
        toSing = ???
    ```

    The singletons for `List` are:

    ```haskell
    SNil  :: Sing 'Nil
    SCons :: Sing x -> Sing xs -> Sing ('Cons x xs)
    ```

    Note that the built-in singletons for the list type also uses these same
    constructor names, for `[]` and `:`.
