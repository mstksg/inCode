It's been almost a year since my last post!  Things have been a bit hectic with
research and related things, and with the unrelenting academia publishing
cycle, any time I can get to write or explore has been a nice escape.

Admittedly, I've also run into some friction updating my blog because it was a
compiled web server with some delicate dependencies and required environment
configuration to build/deploy.  It was written/built at a time when a lot of
the infrastructure we have now in the Haskell ecosystem either wasn't there, or
wasn't mature.  We didn't have easy [Heroku deployment][heroku], and we didn't
have great tools like [stack][] to let us create reproducible builds.  One of
my [first posts][heroku-post] in 2013 was actually about hoops to jump through
*just* to get a simple Heroku deployment.  I've had to maintain a virtual
machine just to compile and push changes!

My blog was one of my first Haskell projects ever, and if I had started it now,
in 2016, things would definitely be a bit different.  By this point, it's been
long enough and the slight inconveniences have been building up enough that I
thought it'd be time to sit down and finally migrate my "first large-ish
Haskell project" and bring it into modern times, by using [hakyll][] and
[purescript][].  Here are my thoughts and observations on how the migration
went, with insight on Haskell migrations in general!

My blog engine is open-source, and the [source for this specific
instance][source] is up on github, for those interested in checking it out!

Hakyll
------

To be honest, there was little actual practical reasons why my site wasn't
static to begin with.  The main reason, feature-wise, was for me to be able to
schedule blog posts and updates without requiring me to actually re-render and
re-push every time I wanted to make a post.  The real underlying reason,
however, was that this blog was my first major Haskell project, and I wanted to
take the opportunity to be able to learn how to interface with databases in
Haskell.

Now that that learning impetus is behind me, I felt free to throw it all out
the window and rewrite things to be a completely 100% static site!

[Hakyll][hakyll] was great; it's basically like a very specialized *make*-like
tool for building sites.  It takes a bit of time to get used to "thinking in
Hakyll" --- generating standalone pages instead of just ones based off of
files, getting used to the identifier/snapshot system --- but once you do,
things go pretty smoothly.  I started thinking about snapshots as customized
"object files" that you can leave behind in the process of creating pages that
other pages can use. Hakyll manages all the dependencies for you, so pages that
depend on the things left from other pages will be sequenced properly, and
rebuilding your website only requires rebuilding pages that depend on files you
changed.  Neat!

Before, I had gotten the impression that Hakyll was mostly for generating
"simple", pre-built blog layouts, but I was able to use Hakyll (without much
friction, at all) to generate the complex, intricate, and arbitrary site map
that I had designed for my [scotty][]-based blog.  I definitely recommend it for
any static site generating needs, blogs or not.

An unexpected consequence of the static-site-hosted-by-github-pages approach,
however, is that I don't have any control over MIME types anymore (or 301
redirects), so I had to do some migrations to move pages over to ".html" and
set up redirects and stuff (and get redirects to work with google analytics),
but those were made super simple with Hakyll.

Refactoring Haskell Code
------------------------

One thing that did not disappoint me was how *easy* and *painless* it is to
refactor Haskell code.  This is something I always trumpet/brag about Haskell,
and getting the opportunity to actually refactor a major-ish codebase.

And, yes, I was not disappointed!  For the most part, I already had my html
templates, CSS, static javascript, etc. in place.  All of the mechanisms were
extremely modular and very easy to port.  The type system made sure everything
fit together well at the boundaries.  They also instantly told me what did
what, and ensured that sweeping changes in my code were safe.  The "if it
compiles, it works" mantra served me greatly here.  I can't even begin to
imagine migrating one of my old ruby projects in the same way.  With this, I
was confident that my compiled code was correct and did what I wanted.  The
types were a guide and also a avenue of insight into my 3-years-removed past
self.

Thanks to the types, I was able to pick up something I hadn't touched in 3
years, figure out how all things fit together, and completely gut everything
apart and use them for a new build system ... with compile-time assurances that
I didn't do anything incorrectly!

It's hard for me to really explain how amazing the feeling of refactoring
Haskell code is.  I used to dread refactors and migrations, but now I look
forward to them and find any opportunity to do one!  :D  It's something that's
difficult to convey the sublime joy of until you actually try it, so I
recommend trying it some day :)

Purescript
----------

### on Fay

With my [last major blog update][fay-update], I ported all of my one-off
javascript scripts to fay.  This time around, I figured I'd move away from
[fay][], because it was slightly clunky to build/get working/integrate in the
way that GHCJS spoiled me to be accustomed to.  In the future, I might return
... but at this point in time, Fay seems a bit awkward in the ecosystem. GHCJS
lets you use the full power of Haskell (including all of *base*'s concurrency
mechanisms and almost every library on hackage), at the expense of creating
large and unreadable javascript blobs.

[fay-update]: http://blog.jle.im/entry/blog-engine-updates-markdown-preprocessor-fay-scripts.html#fay
[fay]: https://github.com/faylang/fay/wiki

Fay seemed like just a *weaker* GHCJS to me, but in all the ways that mattered.
It doesn't have all of the awesome GHC things that make modern Haskell what it
is (not just the lack of base's identical API, but also ... no typeclasses?
Lens abstractions? Hackage libraries?), so almost all of my normal Haskell
programming flow is thrown out the window.  It's a subset of Haskell, but lacks
most of the tools people use to write *actual* Haskell like they'd write
everyday.  The generated javascript blobs are still decently opaque.

So, if you're going to be spending your time writing something that is like
Haskell, but forces you to write it in a way that is nothing like any actual
Haskell code you'd normally write... why even bother keeping up with Haskell
semantics and Haskell compatibility?  Why not break out and try something new
and fresh, unbound by Haskell and compatibility issues?[^bash][^haste]

[^bash]: I definitely don't mean to bash on *fay* here!  It definitely has its
role and place in the ecosystem.  It's for my specific application that I was
looking for an alternative with.

[^haste]: There's another thing here that I skipped over slightly -- [Haste][].
I haven't had much experience with it myself, but for this purpose, I decided
to jump into something not-Haskell and try out something new!

[Haste]: http://haste-lang.org/


### on Purescript

With that mindset, I looked at *[purescript][]*, which is a language that's
inspired by Haskell, with a lot of Haskell features we use every day, and
throws in things we all wish we had in Haskell, like extensible records!

(Note --- I *did* rewrite all of my fay in GHCJS at first.  This resulted in
a javascript blob that was *1.4 MB* in size for just a bunch of small DOM
manipulation scripts.  Definitely not practical, unfortunately!)

I liked that purescript was able to throw away a lot of warts in the Haskell
ecosystem, with a cleaner typeclass hierarchy and just a lot of design
decisions "done right", that we'd all change in Haskell if we could.  And
extensible records being built into the language is quite refreshing; not
having to deal with fancy GADT's in Haskell was a nice step back from the
craziness that is type-level programming in Haskell.  Alongside all of that, I
was also able to rely and seamlessly use a lot of Haskell idioms that we all
know and love, like lenses and traversals and compositions.

At many moments, I felt like writing in Purescript felt like writing in *the
language that Haskell should have been*.

But one of my favorite aspects about purescript ended up being the sheer beauty
and conciseness of the generated javascript.  Look at how[^pshighlight]:

~~~purescript
appendTopLinks doc = do
    hs <- querySelectorAll headers (documentToParentNode doc)
    flip traverseNodeList_ hs \h -> do
      topLink <- createElement "a" doc
      let topLinkNode = elementToNode topLink
      setAttribute "href" "#title" topLink
      setClassName "top-link" topLink
      setTextContent "top" topLinkNode
      appendChild topLinkNode (elementToNode h)
      return unit
~~~

[^pshighlight]: Unfortunately, *[highlighting-kate][]* doesn't yet support purescript syntax
highlighting?

[highlighting-kate]: https://github.com/jgm/highlighting-kate

gets translated to:

~~~javascript
var appendTopLinks = function (doc) {
    return function __do() {
        var v = querySelectorAll(headers)(documentToParentNode(doc))();
        return flip(traverseNodeList_(monadEffEff))(v)(function (h) {
            return function __do() {
                var v1 = createElement("a")(doc)();
                var topLinkNode = elementToNode(v1);
                setAttribute("href")("#title")(v1)();
                setClassName("top-link")(v1)();
                setTextContent("top")(topLinkNode)();
                appendChild(topLinkNode)(elementToNode(h))();
                return unit;
            };
        })();
    };
};
~~~

And it's not just the IO-based imperative code that looks nice, either.
Everything gets compiled to clean, readable javascript that you'd be happy to
import in your node/normal javascript project.

The total exported javascript blob is only *88 kB*, even smaller than fay's
*100 kB* output (but not significantly so), and much smaller than GHCJS's *1.4
MB*[^140MB] output (which, to be fair, has to also contain the entire Haskell
runtime, implementing Haskell semantics, as well).

[^140MB]: A previous version of this post claimed that the javascript bundle
was *140 MB*, instead of *1.4 MB*.  My bad!

Interestingly enough, the *original* raw javacript I wrote in 2013 came out to
about the same size, about *80 kB*.  (Well, it is about *2 kB* of
actual script, but it utilized all of *jquery*, which implements a lot of the
functionality.)  Getting comparable filesizes to jquery bundles is something
that's pretty impressive to me!

I'd recommend purescript to anyone who has to write simple javascript *scripts*
and wants to do it in a sane, beautiful language.  I still use *ghcjs* for
actual *applications*, for now, because I still love Haskell and its ecosystem,
along with the free data type sharing and code re-usage.  But for small scripts
like these, purescript might just be the ideal and perfect solution!

You can check out [the actual purescript script][ps-source] on github!

Conclusions
-----------

My main takeways ---

1.  I will never be able to never work on a Haskell project/application without
    *stack* again (how did we even survive before *stack*?)
2.  Hakyll is a fun little library that is a great specialized *make* for
    building static websites
3.  Refactoring Haskell is an amazing experience; I would recommend it to
    anyone to try it out at least once in their lives
4.  *Purescript* is an amazing and beautiful technology that I had the pleasure of
    learning during this process, and generates elegant, readable javascript
    scripts.

This reflection post has been to help me organize my thoughts, but I hope they
can be useful for those of you looking for new technologies to learn and ways
to implement/approach your stack or next programming project, as well!
