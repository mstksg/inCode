Just a short post to share that I started a github repository of my [Advent of
Code 2017 Solutions][gh], as I write them!

I also am including my [reflections][refl] and explanations on my solutions,
explaining my thought processes and how the solutions work.

Yes I definitely spent a bit too much time writing the executable, which is an
automated (cached) downloader, test suite runner (on sample inputs), and
benchmark suite.

I originally was only going to casually try the problems (like I did last
year), but I hit a decent global rank by accident on Day 4 (which was very
suited for Haskell!), and since then I've been taking things seriously to try
to aim for the global leaderboard (top 100).  This is a struggle for me because
I'm not really the *fastest* algorithm person, but I think it's a fun goal for
me to try to hit this year.

Wish me luck!  And if you haven't started yet, it's not too late to join in the
fun!  [glguy][] has been maintaining the semi-official [Haskell
Leaderboard][lb] (join code `43100-84040706`) -- come join us!
