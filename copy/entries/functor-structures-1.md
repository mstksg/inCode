A style of Haskell programming that I've been pretty excited about with over
the past year or so is something that I can maybe call a "functor structure"
design pattern.  In this post we're going to be exploring the idea of enhancing
normal data types with different types of functor structures step-by-step, by
starting with a simple useful structure and enhancing it piece by piece.  This
process reflects a lot of the way I personally work through these things --- I
normally don't get the whole powerful structure all the way; instead I
incrementally add things as I see how things fit together.

We're going build the tools to describe a *data type schema*, which can
represent algebraic data types --- sums and products.  We'll start off just
building things we can use to *describe* the schema (by printing out
documentation), and by the end of the journey we'll also be able to use our
schema to generate parsers and serializers through json.

This interest in functor structures culminated in my [Functor
Combinatorpedia][fpedia] post last year and the *[functor-combinators][]*
library.  But personally I had never really explored the less commonly used
lowercase-f functor abstractions in Hask --- contravariant functors and
invariant functors until recently.

[fpedia]: https://blog.jle.im/entry/functor-combinatorpedia.html
[functor-combinators]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/functor-combinators

This series is designed for an intermediate Haskeller with familiarity in
things like product/sum types, using `Applicative`/`Alternative`, and monadic
parser combinators, and is written in sync with *functor-combinators-0.3.5.1*.

The Schema
----------

Let's start with the simplest level of describing our schema: a plain ol'
AST describing the possibilities our schema can take.

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/doc.hs "data Schema" "data Field" "data Choice" "data Primitive"
```

Our schema will either represent a record of many different fields, a sum of
many different options, or a primitive value.  If it's a sum type, it'll be
described by a list of `Choice`, which describes each branch.  If it's a record
type, it'll be described by a list of `Field`, which describes each field.  If
it's a primitive type, it'll a `Primitive`, which is either a string, number,
or boolean.

Our end goal is to be able to write a schema for a type like

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/doc.hs "data Customer"
```

and be able to represent documenting, parsing, and printing it all within
`Schema`.  For our basic `Schema` above, this looks like:

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/doc.hs "customerSchema"
```

And a value like

```haskell
PCustomer { cpName = "Sam", cpAge = 40 }
```


might be represented by a json value using our schema like

```json
{ "tag": "Customer",
  "contents":
    { "Name": "Sam"
    , "Age": 40.0
    }
}
```

Documentation
-------------

Using our schema type, let's make a documentation generator.  It'll take a
`Schema` and nicely formatted documentation describing the schema itself.

To make our lives easier, we'll be using the *[prettyprinter][]* library, which
will handle indentation, horizontal and vertical concatenation, and other
printing concerns for us.

[prettyprinter]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/prettyprinter

Let's build things up by defining documentation generators for our individual
types, so they'll be easier to assemble.

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/doc.hs "schemaDoc"4 "fieldDoc ::"1 "choiceDoc ::"1 "primDoc ::"1
```

So `schemaDoc` will take the name of our type and a schema, and generate a
`PP.Doc x`, the type of a text document in the *prettyprinter* library.[^xvar]
And `fieldDoc`, `choiceDoc`, and `primDoc` just generate the documentation for
each individual field or constructor.

(I'm using `x` as the name of the type variable (instead of something
more traditional like `a`) to indicate that it isn't meant to be referenced or
used anywhere in any consistent way.  Just remember it doesn't mean anything
special syntactically!)

The `\case` syntax is known as *LambdaCase syntax*, and `\case blah -> blah` is just sugar
for `\x -> case x of blah -> blah`; we use it extensively here to save us from
having to think of a throwaway variable name.

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/doc.hs "fieldDoc ::" "choiceDoc ::" "primDoc ::"
```

Nothing too fancy here --- since `Field` and `Choice` just have a name and a
sub-schema, we can have them call `schemaDoc`.  `primDoc` requires making our
leaf documentation, so we can just print what type they have.

We tie it all together with `schemaDoc`:

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/doc.hs "schemaDoc"
```

Here we use `PP.vsep`, which takes a list of docs and concatenates them
vertically, `PP.<+>` which concatenates two docs horizontally, and `PP.indent`
which indents things before going down a level.  We appropriately call
`fieldDoc`, `choiceDoc`, and `primDoc` when we actually need to print one of
them.

Hopefully that wasn't too bad!  There were a lot of moving parts because we
have a recursive data type, but in the end hopefully each specific branch was
self-contained enough to understand on their own.  In the end the important
thing to take away isn't the mechanics of document generation, but rather how
the data flows.  Make sure you at least understand how the functions call each
other, and how --- this pattern is going to be very consistent across all the
schema processors we write!

We can test out our function on `customerSchema`, taking
advantage of the fact that `PP.Doc`'s `Show` instance will render the document:

```
ghci> schemaDoc "Customer" customerSchema
(Customer)
Choice of:
  {Person}
    *   Name: string
    *   Age: number
  {Business}
    *   Employees: number
```

It works!

Parsing with Covariance
-----------------------

Now, let's talk about using our `Schema` type to generate a *json parser*.
We want to be able to use our schema type and use it to parse information from
a json value, of a given json format we are expecting.

To do this, we're going to rewrite `Schema` to take a type parameter to
represent the type we want to parse into.  A `Schema a` will be a schema that
can be used to generate documentation *and* describe a parser of `a`s.  In the
end, we want `customerSchema :: Schema Customer`, and a function like

```haskell
schemaParser :: Schema a -> Parse ErrType a
```

to generate a json parser of `a`s.  We'll be using the json parser type `Parse
err a` from *[aeson-better-errors][]* (not because of the better errors, but just
because it's closer to an actual incremental/stateful parser than other
alternatives out there), which can be run with `parse :: Parse err a ->
ByteString -> Either (ParseError err) a`.  So our final interface will look
like:

[aeson-better-errors]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-better-errors

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/parse.hs "parseSchema ::"
```

To do this, we now have to include information on "how to parse an `a`" in our
schema.  "How to parse a record" and "how to parse a sum" are going to be
handled universally for all schemas...so the only thing that really will vary
from type to type (aside from the structure) is how to parse those primitive
leaf types when we encounter them in the json.  And so, the main thing we need
to modify is just `Primitive`:

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/parse.hs "data Primitive"
```

A `Primitive a` now encodes a way to *parse* an `a` if given the appropriate
json primitive.  It can be `PString`, `PNumber`, or `PBool`.  To create a
"String Parser", you need to use `PString` with a function on "what to do with
the string you get".  To create a "Bool parser", you need `PBool` with a
function on what to do with the bool you get.  Note that the `PNumber` parser
takes a `Scientific`, which is the type *aeson* (the underlying json library)
uses to represent valid JSON numbers (it's basically `Either Integer Double`).

We can write some helper primitives:

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/parse.hs "pString ::" "pInt ::" "pBool ::"
```

`pString :: Primitive String` is the most basic way to parse a primitive json
string: just return the `String` itself.  `pInt` needs to reject any
non-integer numbers, so `toBoundedInteger :: Scientific -> Maybe Int` works
well.

We can now start writing our parsers for each branch of `Schema`.  The
`SchemaLeaf` branch should be the simplest.  We can use *aeson-better-error*'s
primitive value parsers:

```haskell
-- | Parse successfuly only if the current value is a String, running the
-- validation function
withString     :: (String     -> Either ErrType a) -> Parse ErrType a

withScientific :: (Scientific -> Either ErrType a) -> Parse ErrType a
withBool       :: (Bool       -> Either ErrType a) -> Parse ErrType a
```

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/parse.hs "primParser ::"
```

Nothing too fancy, mostly plumbing.

### Deducing Ap

However, this small change (and adding the type parameter) leaves in a
predicament.  What should `Schema` look like?

At first glance, we might think we could just write

```haskell
data Schema a =
      RecordType  [Field a]
    | SumType     [Choice a]
    | SchemaLeaf  (Primitive a)
  deriving Functor

!!!functor-structures/parse.hs "data Field"1 "data Choice"1
```

But there's a problem here: `RecordType` is a combination of `Field`s,
but...each `Field` is of a different type!  For example, in our `Customer`
example, the `Person` branch has two fields: `Name` and `Age`.  Our name schema
would look like `nameField :: Field String`, and our age schema would look like
`ageField :: Field Int`...and so you can't really put that into a list like
`[Field a]` since they each have different types.  And further more, we want a
final `Customer` (in our `Schema Customer`), a type which is different from
both `String` and `Int`.

What we need is a way to express heterogeneous collection/sequence of `Field
a`, coupled with a way of "combining" all of them to create an aggregate value
of a final type.  A type that says "use a bunch of `Field` of `x`s of different
types to generate a final `a`".

There are a couple of ways to arrive at this mystery type.  One way is to
recognize "combine a bunch of `f x`s of different types to create an `f b`" is
essentially the M.O. of the *Applicative* abstraction, and so essentially we want
to give `Field` some sort of `Applicative` structure.  And so we can reach for
"the type that gives something an `Applicative` structure", the [free
applicative][].  (This is the strategy I talk about in my [Applicative Regular
Expressions][regexp] post: if you know exactly the interface you want, you can
just use that interface's free structure)

[free applicative]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/free/docs/Control-Applicative-Free.html
[regexp]: https://blog.jle.im/entry/free-alternative-regexp.html

Another way is to think about it as an enhancement along a functor combinator
described in the [functor combinatorpedia][fpedia].  Here we know we want to
enhance `Field` in a specific way, so we can scan the list of functor
combinators until there is one that we need.  And scrolling down, we see:

> [**Ap / Ap1 **](https://blog.jle.im/entry/functor-combinatorpedia.html#ap-ap1)
>
> **Origin**: *[Control.Applicative.Free][]* / *[Data.Functor.Apply.Free][]*
>
> **Enhancement**: The ability to provide multiple `f`s that the interpreter

[Control.Applicative.Free]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/free/docs/Control-Applicative-Free.html
[Data.Functor.Apply.Free]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/functor-combinators/docs/Data-Functor-Apply-Free.html

That sounds like it matches to me!  In order to parse a `RecordType`, we need
to parse *every* `Field`.  It doesn't make any sense to skip one field or the
other: they all need to be processed and parsed.  This sounds like just the
thing we need.

The description here also gives a clue for what we might want to use for
`SumType` (`ListF` sounds like a good companion for the behavior we want sum
type parsers to have)

### Building Ap

With this, we can write our final `Schema` type.

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/parse.hs "data Schema" "data Field" "data Choice" "data Primitive"
```

Note that I switched from `[Choice a]` to `ListF Choice a` as hinted earlier
--- the two are the same, but the latter has the `Functor` instance we want
(`fmap :: (a -> b) -> ListF Choice a -> ListF Choice b`), and is an instance of
useful functor combinator typeclasses.  Furthermore, it illustrates the
symmetry between sum types and record, since `Ap` and `ListF` are contrasting
types: `Ap` can be used to a represent the "product" between many required
fields, and `ListF` can be used to the option between many possible choices.
It's more clear how product types and sum types are "opposites" in a nice clean
way.

We can now make our `Customer` schema:

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/parse.hs "customerSchema ::"
```

The main new thing is using `inject :: Choice a -> ListF Choice a`
and `inject :: Field a -> Ap Field a` to lift our base types into their
appropriate combinators.  Then after that, we just use `Ap`'s `Applicative`
instance and `ListF`'s `Plus` instance to combine them together.  Overall it
should look very similar to the schema we wrote for the documentation section.

### Interpreting Ap

Now, the typical way to "run" an applied functor combinator is with
interpreting functions, like:

```haskell
interpret :: Applicative g => (forall x. f x -> g x) -> Ap    f a -> g a
interpret :: Plus g        => (forall x. f x -> g x) -> ListF f a -> g a
```

You can interpret an `Ap f a` into any `Applicative g`, and you can interpret a
`ListF f a` into any [`Plus g`][Plus] (`Plus` is basically `Alternative`
without an `Applicative` requirement, supporting `(<!>) :: f a -> f a -> f a`).

Basically, the strategy for using `interpret` is that you write a function to
interpret any individual `f` you might find in the structure, and `interpret`
will accumulate them all together for you.

[Plus]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/semigroupoids-5.3.4/docs/Data-Functor-Plus.html

In our case, if we decided to use `interpret`, we could write:

```haskell
interpret :: (forall x. Field  x -> Parse ErrType x) -> Ap    Field  a -> Parse ErrType x
interpret :: (forall x. Choice x -> Parse ErrType x) -> ListF Choice a -> Parse ErrType x
```

Basically, if we have a way to parse each `Field`, then we have a way to parse
an `Ap Field a`.  If we have a way to parse each `Choice`, then we have a way
to parse a `ListF Choice a`.

Let's write those individual parsers for each smaller type:

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/parse.hs "fieldParser ::"
```

Here we use *aeson-better-errors*'s `key :: Text -> Parser a -> Parser a`,
which takes a key and a parser, and runs that parser on whatever is under that
key.  For `fieldParser`, we run the schema parser for our sub-schema under that
key.

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/parse.hs "choiceParser ::"
```

Our sum type encoding has to be a bit more involved, because json doesn't have
any native sum type construct.  The one we're going to use for this post is the
`{"tag": <tag>, "contents": <contents>}"` form.  We're going to parse whatever
is in the key `"tag"`, and if that tag matches our current choice's
constructor, we parse the schema parser for our sub-schema under that key.
Otherwise, this choice isn't what is currently in our json value.

Finally, to wrap bring it all together, we use the `interpret` functions we
talked about:

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/parse.hs "schemaParser ::"
```

And that's it!

Ah well, not exactly so fast.  Even though they could support it,
*aeson-better-errors* doesn't provide `Plus` a for `Parse`.
We can write them as orphans here just because this is a fun learning
experience (but we usually do like to avoid defining instances for types or
typeclasses that aren't ours).

`Alt` and `Plus` represent fallback choices: `x <!> y` will try `x` first, then
if `x` fails, try `y`.

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/parse.hs "instance Monad f =>"
```

And...that should work!

```haskell
ghci> :set -XOverloadedStrings
ghci> parseSchema customerSchema  "{ \"tag\": \"Person\", \"contents\": { \"Name\": \"Same\", \"Age\": 40 } }"
Right (CPerson {cpName = "Same", cpAge = 30})
ghci> parseSchema customerSchema  "{ \"tag\": \"Business\", \"contents\": { \"Employees\": 3 } }"
Right (CBusiness {cbEmployees = 3})
```

We were able to generate a fully functional parser from our schema, by only
providing parsers for the smaller, more specific types we had (`Field` and
`Choice`), and having them all fit together in a way directed by their
`Applicative` and `Plus` typeclass instances.

### Direct Structural Inspection

However, sometimes the typeclass instances aren't really the best way to handle
things.  It gives us a nice principled shortcut --- for example, to interpret
out of an `Ap`, GHC needs a way to know "how to sequence `Parse`s", and so
`interpret` uses the `Applicative` instance for that.  But we know there are
usually different ways to sequence or combine actions --- famously in IO, we
have the option to "sequence" IO actions in series or in parallel, with the
default `Applicative` instance being series sequencing.  So,
offloading our logic to a typeclass can be a convenient route, but it's not
necessarily the behavior we want.

In our case, the `Plus` instance actually combines failed fallback behavior in
an undesirable way: our errors become not too useful, because `<!>` always
picks the right side's errors, and we eventually run into `A.throwCustomError
"No options were validated"`.

```haskell
ghci> parseSchema customerSchema  "{ \"tag\": \"Business\", \"contents\": { \"Employees\": \"Mustard\" } }"
Left (BadSchema [] (CustomError "No options were validated"))
ghci> parseSchema customerSchema  "{ \"tag\": \"Grape\", \"contents\": { \"Color\": \"purple\" } }"
Left (BadSchema [] (CustomError "No options were validated"))
```

Since the definition of `zero` (which was our fault because we wrote it here as
an orphan instance --- oops!) always falls back to the same error, this is not
very useful!

As we see, `interpret` for `ListF`, while convenient, isn't necessarily the
best way to tear down a `ListF`.  Luckily, most functor combinators are just
ADTs that we can pattern match and break down and access the structures
manually.  In the case of `ListF`, the structure is pretty simple:

```haskell
data ListF f a = ListF { runListF :: [f a] }
```

Our `ListF Choice a` is just `[Choice a]`.  This is something we can work
with!  Let's write a better `ListF Choice a` processor by working with the list
itself.

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/parse.hs "schemaParser2 ::"
```

We can use the structure of `ListF` to generate a `Map` associating any tags
with the schemas they are meant to encode.  We then parse the tag, look up what
schema it represents (if any) and then use that schema under the contents key.

```haskell
λ: parseSchema2 customerSchema  "{ \"tag\": \"Business\", \"contents\": { \"Employees\": \"Mustard\" } }"
Left (BadSchema [ObjectKey "contents",ObjectKey "Employees"] (WrongType TyNumber (String "Mustard")))
λ: parseSchema2 customerSchema  "{ \"tag\": \"Grape\", \"contents\": { \"Color\": \"purple\" } }"
Left (BadSchema [] (CustomError "tag Grape not recognized: Expected one of Business, Person"))
```

Much better messages!

### Backporting documentation

Remember that the whole point of this exercise was to *add* functionality to
our schema.  That means we also have to upgrade our documentation function as
well.

Hopefully it is clear from the structure of our data type that we haven't
*lost* any information.  Updating our documentation generator should
be just a matter of changing how to we get the items from our `ListF` and `Ap`.

Following what we just learned, one way to do this would be to use `interpret`
or manually pattern match and take advantage of the structure.  However, if we
just want to get a list of monomorphic items from a functor combinator, there's
a convenient function in *functor-combinators* called `icollect`:[^icollect]

```haskell
icollect :: (forall x. f x -> b) -> ListF f a -> [b]
icollect :: (forall x. f x -> b) -> Ap    f a -> [b]
```

[^icollect]: `icollect` function is nothing magical --- it's essentially
    `interpret` wrapped with `Const`.

    ~~~haskell
    -- essentially
    icollect f = getConst . interpret (\x -> Const [f x])
    ~~~

Give it a function to "get" a `b` out of every `f`, it collects the `b` from
every `f` inside the structure and puts it in a list for us.  Note that this
type is very similar to the `map` we used earlier:

```haskell
-- what we used before
map      :: (          Field   -> b) -> [Field]    -> [b]
-- what we can use now
icollect :: (forall x. Field x -> b) -> Ap Field a -> [b]
```

So it looks like `icollect` should work as a drop-in replacement for `map` ...

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/parse.hs "schemaDoc"
```

Neat, we just had to replace `map (\fld -> ..) fs` with `icollect (\fld -> ...)
fs`, and `map choiceDoc cs` with `icollect choiceDoc cs`.  We were able to
re-use the exact same logic --- we lose no power and upgrading was a
straightforward mechanical transformation.

Contravariant Consumption
-------------------------

Now, let's consider instead the situation where we would want to *serialize*
an `a` with a schema.  We'll make a type `Schema a` that represents something
that can encode an `a` as a json value.  The overall interface of using that
type would be:

```haskell
schemaToValue :: Schema a -> a -> Aeson.Value
```

(`Aeson.Value` being the json representation from the *aeson* library)

To keep things simple, let's forget all the parsing stuff for now; we'll add it
back in later.  Let's just create a type that can *only* serialize by enhancing
our documentation schema.

Again, for the same reasons as before, we can get away with the only
fundamental change being at the leaves/primitives.  Our structure itself is
defined by the ADT, and all of the variations outside of the structure itself
comes from how each leaf is serialized.

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/serialize.hs "data Primitive"
```

A `Primitive a` will be a way to *serialize* a json primitive --- it can be
`PString`, `PNumber`, or `PBool`.  To create a "String Serializer", you need to
use `PString` with a function on "how to turn it into a `String`".  To
create a "Bool parser", you need `PBool` with a function on what how to turn
the value into a `String`.

Again, it can be useful to add some helper primitives:

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/serialize.hs "pString ::" "pInt ::" "pBool ::"
```

`pString :: Primitive String` is the most basic way to serialize a primitive
json string: just return the `String` itself.  `pInt` needs to serialize the
`Int` into a `Scientific` (the numeric type of the aeson library).

We can start off by writing the serializer for `Primitive` just go get a feel
for how our serializer will work:

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/serialize.hs "primToValue ::"
```

Again, nothing too fancy --- mostly plumbing along the *aeson* library's primitive
constructors.

### Covariance vs Contravariance

Before we go further, let's take a moment to pause and discuss the difference
between covariant and contravariant functors, and the usefulness of those
concepts.  "Covariant" functors (or capital-F `Functor`s in Haskell) are
functors `f` where you can consider `f a` as a "producer" of `a` --- for
example, `Schema a` from our parsing section is a thing you can use to
parse/produce an `a` out of a bytestring.  These are things where it makes
sense to `fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b`: if you have a producer of `a`s, you
can always "post-filter" the result with an `a -> b` to get a producer of `b`s.

"Contravariant" functors (`Contravariant` in Haskell) are functors `f` where
you can consider `f a` as a "consumer" of `a`.  For example, `Primtive a` (and
the `Schema a` we want to make) from our serializing section is something that
consums `a`s and produces json values.  These are things where it makes sense
to `contramap`:

```haskell
class Contravariant f where
    contramap :: (a -> b) -> f b -> f a
```

which says: if you have a consumer of `b`s, you can always "pre-filter" the
input with an `a -> b` to get a consumer of `a`s.

### Deducing Dec

Now, back on to building our `Schema` type.  Again, we might want to write
something like

```haskell
data Schema a =
      RecordType  [Field a]
    | SumType     [Choice a]
    | SchemaLeaf  (Primitive a)
  deriving Functor
!!!functor-structures/serialize.hs "data Field"1 "data Choice"1
```

However, we have a problem here (incidentally, it's the opposite of the problem
we had in the previous case).  `Choice a` doesn't quite make sense as the sum
type consumer for `Schema a`, because each `Choice` is only meant to handle the
types in a *specific* branch.  For example, in our `Customer` example, for the
`CPerson` branch we need a `Choice (String, Int)` to consume its contents, and
in the `CBusiness` branch we need a `Choice Int` to consume its contents.

What we need is a way to express a hetereogenous collection/sequence of `Choice
a`, coupled with a way of "choosing" exactly one of them to handle one form
that our input `a` can take.  A type that says "use exactly one of a bunch of
`Choice`s of different `x`s, and choose one to dispatch depending on what `a`
we get".  So how do we find the tool we need?

*If* you are already familiar with contravariant abstractions (but who is?) you
might recognize this as the essence of the [Decidable][] typeclass, from the
*[contravariant][]* library...or more accurately, "Decidable without a
Divisible constraint", which is [Conclude][]. A `Conclude f` allows you to
combine two `f` values, and one will be picked to use based on inspection of
the input value. Upon recognizing this, we look for find a way
to give `Choice` some `Conclude` interface and search up "the type that gives
us a free `Conclude` structure". Following that search, we arrive at
[`Dec`][Dec], and so we use `Dec Choice a` for our sum type consumer.

But let's say you're like the vast majority of Haskell users and have never had
any reason to look at the contravariant abstraction hierarchy.  How would you
think of this?

Like before, we could also look through the [functor combinatorpedia][fpedia] (in
specific, the contravariant section) and find:

Sounds like exactly what we need!  It also gives us a nice hint of what we
might want to use for `RecordType`.

### Building Dec

With this, we can write our final `Schema` type.

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/serialize.hs "data Schema" "data Field" "data Choice" "data Primitive"
```

Note that I switched from `[Field a]` to `Div Field a` --- the two are the same
(`Div Field a` is essentially a newtype wrapper over `[Field a]`), but the
latter has useful functor combinator typeclass instance methods like `interpret`
(like `ListF` before)[^contramap].  And, again, I feel like it illustrates the symmetry
between sum types and record types; `Div` and `Dec` are opposite types, as
`Dec` represents a contravariant choice between different choices, and `Div`
represents a contravariant merger between different consumers.  It makes more
clear the duality between product types and sum types.

[^contramap]: And, if we want it, it has the more useful `Contravariant`
    instance: `contramap :: (a -> b) -> Div Field b -> Div Field a`.

We can assemble our `Customer` schema, in a way that looks a lot like our
parser schema:

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/serialize.hs "customerSchema ::"
```

Here we use a few contravariant combinators to combine and merge contravariant
functors values (like `Div Field a` and `Dec Choice a`):

`decide` works like:

```haskell
decide
    :: Conclude f
    => (a -> Either b c)    -- ^ break into branches
    -> f b                  -- ^ handle first branch
    -> f c                  -- ^ handle second branch
    -> f a                  -- ^ overall handler

decide
    :: (Customer -> Either (String, Int) Int)   -- ^ break into branches
    -> Dec Choice (String, Int)                 -- ^ handle CPerson branch
    -> Dec Choice Int                           -- ^ handle CBusiness branch
    -> Dec Choice Customer
```

And `divided` works like:

```haskell
divided
    :: Divisible f
    => f a          -- ^ first handler
    -> f b          -- ^ second handler
    -> f (a, b)     -- ^ merged handler

divided
    :: Div Field String          -- ^ handle the cpName field
    -> Div Field Int             -- ^ handle the cpAge field
    -> Div Field (String, Int)   -- ^ handle both together
```


### Interpreting Dec

To write our schema serializers, we can use `interpret` again:

```haskell
interpret :: Divisible g => (forall x. Field  x -> g x) -> Div Field  a -> g a
interpret :: Conclude g  => (forall x. Choice x -> g x) -> Dec Choice a -> g a
```

But, what should we choose as our choice of `g`?

```haskell
choiceToValue :: Choice a -> g a
```

Well, how do we want to "use" a `Choice a`?  Remember that `Schema a` encodes a
way to serialize an `a` to an json value.  A `Choice a` would encode a way to
serialize an `a` into a json value.  We want to turn a `Choice a` into an `a ->
Aeson.Value`:

```haskell
choiceToValue :: Choice a -> (a -> Aeson.Value)

-- is supposed to match up with
choiceToValue :: Choice a -> g a
```

So, we need to pick some `g` where `g a` is `a -> Aeson.Value`.  This is exactly
`Op` from *[Data.Functor.Contravariant][]*, in *base*:

```haskell
data Op r a = Op { getOp :: a -> r }
```

[Data.Functor.Contravariant]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Data-Functor-Contravariant.html

So, if we write

```haskell
choiceToValue :: Choice a -> Op Aeson.Value a

-- a newtype wrapper away from
choiceToValue :: Choice a -> a -> Aeson.Value
```

then we have

```haskell
interpret choiceToValue :: Dec Choice a -> Op Aeson.Value a

-- a newtype wrapper away from
interpret choiceToValue :: Dec Choice a -> a -> Aeson.Value
```

Let's write it!

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/serialize.hs "choiceToValue ::"
```

Now onto `RecordType`'s `Div Field `. Here, we want to build an object using
`Aeson.object :: [Aeson.Pair] -> Aeson.Value` (one way that the *aeson* library
allows us to build objects). Therefore, our type for `fieldToValue` should be:

```haskell
fieldToValue :: Field a -> a -> [Aeson.Pair]
```

This looks familiar; it's the same thing as before, but with `Op [Aeson.Pair]`
instead of `Op Aeson.Value`.

```haskell
fieldToValue :: Field a -> Op [Aeson.Pair] a

interpret fieldToValue :: Div Field a -> Op [Aeson.Pair] a

-- a newtype wrapper away from
interpret fieldToValue :: Div Field a -> a -> [Aeson.Pair]
```

We can go ahead and write it out, actually:

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/serialize.hs "fieldToValue ::"
```

(Note that this behavior relies on the fact that the `interpret` instance for
`Div` --- using the `Divise` instance for `Op r` --- will combine the `[Aeson.Pair]`
list monoidally, concatenating the results of calling `fieldToValue` on every
`Field` in the `Div Field a`.)

We should now have enough to write our entire serializer:

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/serialize.hs "schemaToValue"
```

Running our `schemaToValue` on a sample `Person` gives the json value we
expect:

```
ghci> Aeson.encode (schemaToValue customerSchema (CPerson "Sam" 40))
{"tag":"Person","contents":{"Age":40,"Name":"Sam"}}
```

#### Some Convenience

Note that this contravariant interpretation pattern (wrapping in `Op` and then
unwrapping it again to run it) is so common that *functor-combinators* has a
helper function to make things a bit neater:

```haskell
iapply  :: (forall x. f x -> x -> b) -> Dec f a -> a -> b
ifanout :: (forall x. f x -> x -> b) -> Div f a -> a -> [b]
```

With these we could write

```haskell
choiceToValue :: Choice a -> a -> Aeson.Value
fieldToValue  :: Field a  -> a -> Aeson.Pair
```

And then:

```haskell
iapply choiceToValue :: Dec Choice a -> a -> Aeson.Value
ifanout fieldToValue :: Div Field  a -> a -> [Aeson.Pair]
```

### Backporting documentation

Because our new structure is pretty much the same as before (data types wrapped
by functor combinators), and `Div`/`Dec` support `icollect` just like
`Ap`/`ListF` did before, the implementation of `schemaDoc` is pretty much
word-for-word identical as it was for our parser schema:

```haskell
!!!functor-structures/serialize.hs "schemaDoc"
```

Neat!

Looking Forward
---------------

We first started with a simple structure to represent our schema.  We then
added *covariant* capabilities to get us parser generation.  Then we added
*contravariant* capabilities to get us serializers.

The next step might be to add *both* enhancements to the same structure!  The
benefits for this seem pretty significant: we can write our structure once
(less code, less bugs), and we also write our serializer, parser, and
documenting functions in a way that are automatically kept in-sync, and can
never be incompatible with each other.  Solving the documentation rot and
mismatched parser/serializer problem in one stroke!

For this, we'll wait until the next post, where we explore not one, but two
ways to combine our two capabilities into something known as an *invariant*
functor!
