The other day I ran into [this video][] of a pilot of a jet plane apparently
pouring water from a bottle into a cup while in the middle of a roll.  The
interesting effect is that the water continues to flow into the cup, apparently
defying gravity, throughout the entirety of the roll.  The camera follows the
plane's rotation, so it looks like the water is being poured normally the entire
time, even though the ground is seen rotating around the plane in the
background.

In the ensuing discussion, someone commented this was a good example
demonstrating *centrifugal force*.  Someone then replied "*Actually, it's the
centripetal force.*"

I replied, and in the process of explaining why centripetal force *doesn't*
explain what is happening here, I came to realize a few key misconceptions that
people have when thinking about "fictitious" (or pseudo-, or inertial) forces.

Two Sides Of A Coin?
--------------------

Do you subscribe to this view?

> The centrifugal force is not a "real force", because it's just "the
> centripetal force" in disguise.  Every usage of the centrifugal force can be
> re-interpreted as "the centripetal force", and vice versa.  It's just two
> ways of looking at the same thing.

This sort of view trains you into thinking that, if you see a "centrifugal
force", you should find the "real force" that is responsible for it.  And that
"real force" is "the centripetal force".  That's what's *really* happening...
right?  Newton's third law!

This fallacy is exactly what struck Commenter B.  Commenter B saw something
that could be interpreted as a centrifugal force.  Their logic then proceeded
thusly:

*   Ah, everyone knows that the centrifugal force isn't a "real force".  I have
    to correct it.
*   Well, what's the *real* force behind the water falling into the cup?
*   Isn't the centrifugal force just "the centripetal force", but in a
    different viewpoint?
*   So, it must be "the centripetal force"!

Of course, if you do hold the viewpoint above, this all feels justified.  And
you feel satisfied that you were able to [give a name to the
phenomenon][nominal fallacy].  That is, until you think about it a little
deeper.

Remember, the original question is "When the water is in the air, what is
causing it to move towards the cup?"

If your answer is "the centripetal force", then you have some
problems...because you then have to explain where the force is coming from.
It's not gravity, and it's not the spinning motion of the plane (that's going
"sideways", the opposite direction of a centripetal force).  So, what is it?
What force is acting on the water?

How can we have a centrifugal force without a centripetal force?

And that's where you start to see that, no matter what your views on the
metaphysical reality of fictitious forces are, "centripetal force" is certainly
*not* the explanation.

So...what is?

Down to the root of it
----------------------

### The Centripetal Fallacy

You might have noticed why I have been writing "the centripetal force" in
quotes.  The reason?  There is no such thing as "the centripetal force".  It's
a lie.

One only needs to check the first words of the Wikipedia articles and compare
the difference to see:

*   **[Centrifugal Force][]**: *The centrifugal force is...*
*   **[Centripetal Force][]**: *A centripetal force is...*

[Centrifugal Force]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force
[Centripetal Force]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force

Huh.  One says "the".  The other says "a".  What's the difference?

The difference is that "centripetal" is a *role* that a force plays.  It is an
adjective, like "dampening", "supporting", big, small, little, weak, strong,
upwards-pointing, etc.  There is no such thing as "*the* centripetal force", in the
sense that we have "the gravitational force".  There are only forces that are
acting in a centripetal way, or play a centripetal role in our current context.

We call a force "centripetal" when it is directed towards a center of rotation,
and causes the object's trajectory to follow a circular path.

There is no such thing as "the centripetal force".  There are only forces that
are playing a centripetal role in our system.  There might be many, there might
be none, or there might be just one.

Ironically, it's "centrifugal" that is "not a real force", but rather just a
mask that other forces can don and wear.

### Centrifugal Roots

So, what is *the* centrifugal force?
