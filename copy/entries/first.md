Throughout my time programming and developing, I've noticed that there are few
legitimately useful sources of practical and beneficial knowledge on the
subject on the internet.  There are good books.  There is
[Stack Overflow][stackoverflow].  And there are the blogs.

[stackoverflow]: http://www.stackoverflow.com

I've probably learned more useful information from blogs than I have from
nearly any other source --- from small things like how to fix that compile
error on ffmpeg or teaching me my first steps in learning tools I now use
every day like git.  From blogs I've learned not just small things that help
me here and there, but also the building blocks that I have to thank for
allowing me to learn so much of what I know now.

In addition to these, blogs are the theatre of many gifted essayists, who
are always enthusiastic to share their insight from the deeper aspects of what
programming actually means, and their roles in the construction of the world
we live in today.

Having worked on my fair share of projects, I've accumulated some meager,
humble practical knowledge from the field over these short years.  So this is
my opportunity to finally give back.  My hope is first to fill in all of those
small holes in knowledge that happen to slip through and can sometimes only be
found with the perfect google search.  Second to share a bit of my discoveries
along my journeys in development and any relevant insights from my studies
that may be useful to others.  Third, to share any mature open source projects
I'm working on that may be of use to the world.  And forth, to maybe shine
some light on greater themes that I have noticed when looking back on things.

It's also been said that blogs are a good way for someone to help themselves
organize their thoughts and kind of put them all together.  Maybe if I log my
progress on projects as I go along, I can look back and refer to them later.
And maybe --- just maybe --- they can be useful to other humans.

So anyways, this is it.  Welcome to **in Code**!
