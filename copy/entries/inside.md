I like Haskell because it lets me live inside my world.

There are a lot of special worlds out there!  And Haskell lets me stay in
those worlds, and use all of the tools I normally have when I'm not there.  I
get to transform normal tools into tools that work in my world.

(This post is meant to be approachable by people unfamiliar with Haskell!
That being said, if there is a concept you don't understand, feel free to
leave a comment, [tweet][] me, stop by on irc at freenode's #haskell, or give
[Learn You a Haskell][LYAH] a quick read!)

Stuck in Maybe
--------------

(Feel free to play along with the code in this section by [loading it into
ghci][insidemaybe], the Haskell interpreter!)

!!![insidemaybe]:inside/maybe.hs

In Haskell, we have a type called `Maybe a`:

~~~haskell
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
~~~

This says that `Maybe a` is like an Enumerable type of sorts; The `|` reads
like "*or*".

This is like saying

~~~haskell
data Bool = False | True
~~~

to define a `Bool` data type.  If I have something of type `Bool`, it can be
(literally) `False` or `True`.  If I have something of type `Maybe a`, it can
be `Nothing` (nothing is there, it's empty) or `Just x` (it contains a value
`x`).

If you are used to an OOP language with templates or generics, this is
similar to saying `Maybe<a>` -- `Maybe<a>` is a parameterized type over some
`a`.

This type is useful for functions that might fail:

~~~haskell
!!!inside/maybe.hs "-- divideMaybe:" "-- headMaybe:" "-- halveMaybe:" inside-my-world
~~~

::::: {.note}
**Aside**

Oh hi!

For people new to Haskell:

~~~haskell
foo :: Int -> Bool
foo x = ...
~~~

declares a function named `foo` of type `Int -> Bool` --- we use `::` to
specify type signatures.  `Int -> Bool` means that it takes an `Int` (named
`x`) and returns a `Bool`.

I'll often just say `bar :: Bool` to say "the value `bar` (of type `Bool`)";
you could just read `::` as "type of".

So `divideMaybe :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int` means that `divideMaybe` takes two
`Int`s and returns something of type `Maybe Int`.

You might have also noticed the pattern matching construct, `headMaybe (x:_)`.
This matches the first element in the list to the name `x`, and the rest of
the list to the wildcard, `_`.
:::::

When you want to return a value of type `Maybe a`, you can either return `Just
x` or `Nothing` (where `x :: a`) --- they both are members of type `Maybe a`.
That's what `Maybe Int` means --- an `Int` that might or might not be there!

If I had something of type `Maybe Int`, would you know for sure if that `Int`
was there or not (from just the type)?  You wouldn't!  You are living in the
world of uncertainties.

Welcome to the world of uncertainty.[^dundundun]

[^dundundun]: Dun dun dun!

### The Problem

Okay, well, I have a `Maybe Int`.  Which is nice and all...but...I want to do
normal inty-things with it.

That is...I have all these functions that work only on `Int`!

~~~haskell
!!!inside/maybe.hs "addThree ::" "square ::" "showInt ::" inside-my-world
~~~

But...I can't do these things on `Maybe Int`!

~~~haskell
ghci> addThree (Just 5)
*** SCARY ERROR!
*** addThree takes an Int but you gave it a Maybe Int.
*** What are you trying to do anyway, wise guy.
~~~

::::: {.note}
**Aside**

In this post, commands at the interactive Haskell interpreter (REPL) ghci are
prefaced with the prompt `ghci>`.  If you see `ghci>`, it means that this is
something you'd enter at ghci.  If not, it is normal Haskell source code!

In `ghci`, we also have this command `:t` that you'll be seeing often that
lets you find the type of something:

```haskell
ghci> :t True
True :: Bool
```

:::::


In most other languages, to get around this, you would "exit" your uncertain
world.  That is, you would turn your uncertain 5 into either a certain 5 or an
error.  Or you would turn your uncertain 5 into either a certain 5 or some
"default" value.

That is, you would use functions like these to exit your world:[^fjfm]

[^fjfm]: In the standard libraries, `certaintify` and `certaintifyWithDefault`
exist in the `Data.Maybe` module as `fromJust` and `fromMaybe`, respectively.

~~~haskell
!!!inside/maybe.hs "certaintify ::" "certaintifyWithDefault ::" inside-my-world
~~~

And then you can just willy-nilly use your normal `Int -> Int` functions on
what you pull out...using various "error handling" mechanisms if it was
`Nothing`.

~~~haskell
ghci> addThree (certaintify (headMaybe [1,2,3]))
4
ghci> square (certaintify (halveMaybe 7))
*** Exception: Nothing was there, you fool!
ghci> square (certaintifyWithDefault 0 (halveMaybe 7))
0
~~~

But...work with me here.  Let's say I want to live in my uncertain world.

There are a lot of reasons why one might want to do that.

Let's say you had a function that looked up a person from a database given
their ID number.  But not all ID numbers have a person attached, so the
function might fail and not lookup anyone.

~~~haskell
personFromId :: ID -> Maybe Person
~~~

And you also had a function that returned the age of a given person:

~~~haskell
age :: Person -> Int
~~~

What if you wanted to write a function that looked up *the age of the person
in that database with that ID*.  The result is going to also be in a  `Maybe`,
because the given ID might not correspond to anyone to have an age for.

~~~haskell
ageFromId :: ID -> Maybe Int
~~~

In this case, it would make no sense to "exit" the world of uncertainty as
soon as we get a `Maybe Person`, and then "re-enter" it somehow when you
return the `Maybe Int`.  Our entire answer is shrouded in uncertainty, so we
need to *stay inside this world* the entire time.  We want to find a way to
deal with values inside a world *without leaving it*.

So we have a function `Person -> Int`, and a `Maybe Person`...darnit.  How do
we use our `age` function, without leaving `Maybe`?  We certainly want to
re-use the same function somehow, and not write it again from scratch!

### Can I have a lift?

So the problem:  I have a function `a -> b` that I want to be able to use
on a `Maybe a`...I want to stay in my `Maybe` world and use that function on
the uncertain value.

If you look at this carefully, we want some sort of "function transformer".
Give our transformer an `a -> b`, it'll output a new function `Maybe a -> Maybe
b`.  The new function takes an `a` that may or may not be there, and outputs a
`b` that may or not be there.

We want a function of type `(a -> b) -> (Maybe a -> Maybe b)`

Let's make one!  It'll apply the function to the value inside a `Just`, and
leave a `Nothing` alone.

~~~haskell
!!!inside/maybe.hs "inMaybe ::" inside-my-world
~~~

What can we do with it?

~~~haskell
ghci> let addThreeInMaybe = inMaybe addThree
ghci> addThreeInMaybe (Just 7)
Just 10
ghci> addThreeInMaybe Nothing
Nothing
ghci> (inMaybe square) (Just 9)
Just 81
ghci> (inMaybe showInt) Nothing
Nothing
ghci> (inMaybe showInt) (Just 8)
Just "8"
~~~

Wow!  We can now use normal functions and still stay inside my uncertain
world.  We could even write our `ageFromId`:

~~~haskell
!!!inside/maybe.hs "ageFromId ::" inside-my-world
~~~

Now we are no longer afraid of dealing with uncertainty.  It's a scary realm,
but as long as we have `inMaybe`...all of our normal tools apply!

~~~haskell
ghci> let x = headMaybe [2,3,4]        -- x = Just 2
ghci> let y = (inMaybe square) x       -- y = Just 4
ghci> let z = (inMaybe addThree) y     -- z = Just 7
ghci> (inMaybe (> 5)) z
Just True
ghci> let x' = halveMaybe 7            -- x' = Nothing
ghci> let y' = (inMaybe square) x'     -- y' = Nothing
ghci> let z' = (inMaybe addThree) y'   -- z' = Nothing
ghci> (inMaybe (> 5)) z'
Nothing
~~~

### Functor

This concept of "bringing functions into worlds" is actually a useful and
generalizable concept.  In fact, in the standard libraries, there's a
typeclass (which is like an interface, sorta, for you Java/OOP people) that
provides a common API/interface for "worlds that you can bring functions
into."

We call it `Functor`, and this "bring into world" function is called `fmap`.

It should come as no surprise that `Maybe` is a Functor, so `fmap` *does*
take any function `a -> b` and "lifts" it into the `Maybe` world, turning it
into a `Maybe a -> Maybe b`.

`fmap` for `Maybe` is incidentally exactly our `inMaybe`.

~~~haskell
ghci> (fmap square) (headMaybe [4,5,6])
Just 16
ghci> (fmap square) (halveMaybe 7)
Nothing
~~~

::::: {.note}
**Aside**

Any "legitimate" instance of `Functor` must satisfy a couple of
properties --- "laws", so to speak.  These laws basically ensure that whatever
instance you define is useful and sensible, and follow what sort of meaning
`fmap` is supposed to convey.

1.  `fmap (f . g)` should equal `fmap f . fmap g`; that is, lifting composed
    functions be the same as composing lifted functions. (`(.)` is the
    function composition operator)
2.  `fmap id thing` should leave `thing` unchanged.

:::::


Some notes before we move on!

First of all, even though we have been writing things like `(fmap f) x`, the
parentheses are actually unnecessary due to the way Haskell associates function
calls.  So `(fmap f) x` is the same as `fmap f x`, and we'll be writing it
that way from now on.

Secondly, an infix operator alias for `fmap` exists: `(<$>)`.  That way, you
can write `fmap f x` as `f <$> x`, which is meant to look similar to `f $ x`:

~~~haskell
ghci> addThree $ 7
10
ghci> addThree <$> Just 7
Just 10
ghci> addThree <$> Nothing
Nothing
~~~

(For those unfamiliar, `f $ x` = `f x`)


### Sort of a big deal

Let's pause and reflect to see that this is sort of a big deal, and see what
problem `Functor` just solved.

In another language, you might somehow have a `Maybe<Int>` (using generics
syntax).  And you have lots and lots and lots of functions that take `Int`s.
Heck, why would you even ever have a function take a `Maybe<Int>`?  A function
would be like:

~~~java
class Monster {
    void deal_damage(int damage) {};
}
~~~

where your `deal_damage` function would take an integer.  So `Maybe Int` is
useless!  You either have to re-write `deal_damage` to take a `Maybe Int`, and
have *two versions* of it, or you turn your `Maybe Int` into an `Int` somehow.

In this light, `Maybe` is a huge nuisance.  It is a big, annoying thing to
deal with and it probably results in a lot of boilerplate, making you either
duplicate functions or extract `Maybe` values every time you get one.

But now...*now*, `Maybe` is not a nuisance, and there is *no boilerplate*.
All your functions now...*just work*, as they are!

And this is a big deal.


## "Pre-lifting"

Okay, so we now can turn `a -> b` into `Maybe a -> Maybe b`.

That might be nice, but if you scroll up just a bit, you might see that there
are other functions that might be interesting to apply on a `Maybe a`.

What about `halveMaybe :: Int -> Maybe Int`?  Can I use `halveMaybe` on a
`Maybe Int`?

~~~haskell
ghci> let x = divideMaybe 12 3     -- x = Just 4 :: Maybe Int
ghci> halveMaybe x
*** SCARY ERROR!
*** halveMaybe takes an Int but you gave it
*** a Maybe Int.  Please think about your life.
~~~

Oh no!  Maybe we can't really stay inside our `Maybe` world after all!

This might be important!  Let's imagine this trip down our world of
uncertainty --- let's say we wanted a function `halfOfAge`

~~~haskell
halfOfAge :: ID -> Maybe Int
~~~

That returns (possibly), half of the age of the person corresponding to that
ID (and `Nothing` if the person looked up has an odd age.  Because odd ages
don't have halves, of course.).  Well, we already have `ageFromId :: ID ->
Maybe Int`, but we want to apply `halveMaybe` to that `Maybe Int`.  But we
can't!  Because `halveMaybe` only works on `Int`!

We can't even use `fmap`, because:

~~~haskell
ghci> :t fmap halveMaybe
fmap halveMaybe :: Maybe Int -> Maybe (Maybe Int)
~~~

Wrong wrong wrong!  We don't want a `Maybe Int -> Maybe (Maybe Int)`, we want
a `Maybe Int -> Maybe Int`!  `fmap` lifts "both sides" of the function, but we
only want, in this case, to "lift" the input.

This is a disaster!

But wait, calm down.  We have overcome similar things before.  With our recent
journey to Functor enlightenment in mind, let's try to look for a similar
path.

We had an `a -> b` that we wanted to apply to a `Maybe a`, we used `fmap` to
turn it into a `Maybe a -> Maybe b`.  So we have a `a -> Maybe b` here that we
want to apply to a `Maybe a`.  The plan is simple!  We turn an `a -> Maybe b`
into a `Maybe a -> Maybe b`. Let's pretend we had such a function.

~~~haskell
liftInput :: (a -> Maybe b) -> (Maybe a -> Maybe b)
~~~

How should we expect this to behave?

Well, let's think this through case-by-case.

If we want to apply `halveMaybe` to a number that isn't there...well...it
should also return a number that isn't there.  It should propagate the
not-thereness.

If we want to apply `halveMaybe` to a number that *is* there...well, just
apply it to that number, and take that result!  If the result is there, then
you have a result there.  If the result is not there, then you don't.

We have enough to write this out ourselves:

~~~haskell
!!!inside/maybe.hs "liftInput ::" inside-my-world
~~~

~~~haskell
ghci> :t liftInput halveMaybe
Maybe Int -> Maybe Int
ghci> let x = divideMaybe 12 3     -- x = Just 4 :: Maybe Int
ghci> (liftInput halveMaybe) x
Just 2
ghci> let y = divideMaybe 12 0     -- y = Nothing :: Maybe Int
ghci> (liftInput halveMaybe) y
Nothing
~~~

Neat!  Now we don't have to fear `a -> Maybe b`'s...we can use them and *still
stay in our world*, without leaving our world of uncertainty!

~~~haskell
!!!inside/maybe.hs "halfOfAge ::" inside-my-world
~~~

### Monad

Like with Functor and `fmap`, this general pattern of turning an `a -> f b`
into an `f a -> f b` is also useful to generalize.

In general, you can think functions `a -> world b` as functions that "bring
you into your world".  We would like to turn it, in general, into `world a ->
world b`.  Lifting the input only, so to speak.

We say that if a world has such a way of lifting the input of such a function
(plus some other requirements), it implements the `Monad`
typeclass[^othermonad].

[^othermonad]: It also needs `return`, which I will mention in due time.

Monad is a typeclass (which is kinda like an interface), so that means that
if `Maybe` is a Monad, it "implements" that way to turn a `a -> Maybe b`
into a `Maybe a -> Maybe b`.

We call this `(a -> Maybe b) -> (Maybe a -> Maybe b)` function "bind".

Now, embarrassingly enough, "bind" actually isn't called `bind` in the standard
library...it actually only exists as an operator, `(=<<)`.

(Remember how there was an operator form of `fmap`?  We have both `fmap` and
`(<$>)`?  Well, in this case, we *only* have the operator form of `bind`,
`(=<<)`. Yeah, I know.  But we live with it just fine!).

`(=<<)` is exactly our `liftInput` for `Maybe`.  Let's try it out:

~~~haskell
ghci> :t (=<<) halveMaybe
Maybe Int -> Maybe Int
ghci> let x = divideMaybe 12 3     -- x = Just 4 :: Maybe Int

-- use it as a prefix function
ghci> (=<<) halveMaybe x
Just 2
ghci> let y = divideMaybe 12 0     -- y = Nothing :: Maybe Int

-- use it as an infix operator
ghci> halveMaybe =<< y
Nothing
~~~

And now maybe we can finally rest easy knowing that we can "stay inside
`Maybe`" and never have to leave it.

::::: {.note}
**Aside**

The "other thing" that Monad has to have (the other thing that the
"interface" demands, besides `(=<<)`) is a way to "bring a value into your
world".

This function is called `return`.

For example, for `Maybe`, we need a way to take a normal value like an `Int`
and "bring it into" our world of uncertainty --- an `Int -> Maybe Int`.  For
`Maybe`, semantically, to bring something like `7` into the world of
uncertainty...well, we already know the `7` is there.  So to bring a `7` into
`Maybe`, it's just `Just 7`

For an instance of `Monad` to be considered legitimate, there are a few
rules/laws that `return` and `(=<<)` must obey when used together in order to
be useful (just like for `Functor`).  If you define nonsensical `return` and
`(=<<)`, of course, your instance won't be very useful anyway, and you
wouldn't be able to reason with how they work together.  The laws sort of are
some way of ensuring that your instance is useful and sensible, and that
`(=<<)` and `return` make sense at all.
:::::


::::: {.note}
**Aside**

Now, for some strange reason, it is actually much more popular to use `(>>=)`
over `(=<<)`; `(>>=)` is just `(=<<)` backwards:

~~~haskell
ghci> halveMaybe =<< Just 8
Just 4
ghci> Just 8 >>= halveMaybe
Just 4
~~~

This is really weird!  I mean...really *really* weird!  Why would you ever put
the function you are applying *after* the value you are applying it to?
That's like having `x :: a` and `f :: a -> b`, and doing `x f` or something!

Why is this style the norm?  Who knows![^whoknows]  People are just weird!

[^whoknows]: I know!  And I'm not telling!  Just kidding.

    `(>>=)` is actually a lot of times more useful than `(=<<)`, despite its
    awkward reversed nature.

    One major reason is that things end up looking more "imperative" (which
    may or may not be desired).  Imagine `divideMaybe 12 3 >>= halveMaybe >>=
    halveMaybe` versus `halveMaybe =<< halveMaybe =<< divideMaybe 12 3`.

    Believe it or not, usage of Monads was originally motivated by structuring
    IO actions.  So, in that setting, it seemed natural to have an
    "imperative-y" feel.

    Also, in the popular "do notation" syntactical sugar, `(>>=)` is used in
    the desugaring and not `(=<<)`, so `(>>=)` pops out naturally when
    reasoning about Monads coming through do notation.

    Also, whenever you use lambda syntax (like `(\x -> f x)`), `(>>=)`
    might be nice, because lambda syntax carries some sort of inherent
    left-to-rightness in it with the arrow.  It's also tricky to write
    "chained binds" using lambda syntax using `(=<<)` --- try writing `f >>=
    (\x -> g >>= (\y -> h x y))` using `(=<<)` and you'll see that it's
    slightly less natural.

    Still, it is worth being aware that `(>>=)` is a is a bit "different" from
    the rest of the pack of normal Haskell function application and
    composition operators; it is unique in that it is the only one where the
    backwards form is more common than the normal one.

    Even the term "bind" is often used to refer to both.

    A general guideline is that you ever mix a bind with a `(<$>)` and/or a
    `($)` and `(.)`, you should prefer `(=<<)`, to prevent your eyes from
    jumping directions.

For the rest of this article, we will be using `(=<<)`; just be aware that you
might see `(>>=)` out in the wild more often!
:::::

Recap
-----

Thanks to Functor and Monad, we now have a way to confidently stay in our
world of uncertainty and still use normal functions on our uncertain values
--- we only have to use the right "lifters".

If you have an `x :: Maybe a` and you have a:

*   `f :: a -> b`, then use `fmap` or `(<$>)` --- `fmap f x` or `f <$> x`

*   `f :: a -> Maybe b`, then use `(=<<)` --- `f =<< x`

Armed with these two, you can comfortably stay in `Maybe` without ever having
to "get out of it"!

### A big picture

Again, the big picture is this: sometimes we get values inside contexts, or
worlds.  But we have functions like `a -> world b` that *produce values inside
your world*.

Which normally would leave you "high and dry", because you can't, say, apply
that same function twice.  You either have to write a new `world a -> world b`
version or some other boilerplate.

With Functor, we can make normal functions treat our world values like normal
values; with Monad, we can do the same with functions that "bring us into"
worlds.  With these two together...maybe contexted values aren't so bad after
all!


Other Worlds
------------

### on Worlds

You might have noticed that up until now I have used the word "world" pretty
vaguely.

When I say that a value is "inside" a "world", I mean that it "lives" inside
the context of what that world represents.   A `Maybe a` is an `a` living in
the `Maybe` "world" --- it is an `a` that can exist or not exist.  `Maybe`
represents a context of existing-or-not-existing.[^worlds]

[^worlds]: In Haskell, "worlds" are represented at the type level as type
    constructors.  `Maybe` is a type constructor that takes a type like `Int` and
    returns a new type, `Maybe Int`.  Not all type constructors represent
    Worlds, of course.

But there are other worlds, and other contexts too.  And though I have shown
you what Functor and Monad look like for `Maybe`...you probably need to
see a few more examples to be really convinced that these are general design
patterns that you can apply to multiple "values in contexts".

It's important to remember that `fmap` and `(=<<)` don't really have any
inherent semantic meaning...and their usefulness and "meaning" come from just
the specific instance.  We saw what they "did" for `Maybe`, but their meaning
came from `Maybe` itself.  For other worlds, as we will see, we can make them
mean completely different things.

::::: {.note}
**Aside**

There are some important nuances that might trip you up!  Though useful worlds
are instances of Monad, it is improper to say that "Monads are worlds/values
in contexts".  That's not what Monads *are*.  Monads are just Monads (the two
functions and their laws), no more and no less.

In our usage here, Functor and Monad mean only "these things implement some
sort of `fmap` and `(=<<)`, etc., and those two are useful."  That is, the
interface offered by Functor and Monad are useful for our specific world.  But
there are plenty of Functors and Monads that are not "worlds".
:::::

Anyways, here is a whirlwind tour of different worlds, to help you realize how
often you'll actually want to live in these worlds in Haskell, and why having
`fmap` and `(=<<)` are so useful!

### The world of future values

(Play along with this section too by [loading the source][insidereader]!)

!!![insidereader]:inside/reader.hs

In Haskell, we have a `Reader r` world.  You can think of `(Reader r) a` as a
little machine that "waits" for something of type `r`, then *uses* it to
(purely) make an `a`.  The `a` doesn't exist yet; it's a future `a` that will
exist as soon as you give it an `r`.

~~~haskell
!!!inside/reader.hs "-- futureLength:" "-- futureHead:" "-- futureOdd:" inside-my-world
~~~

`futureLength` is a "future `Int`"; an `Int` waiting (for an `[a]`) to be realized.
`futureHead` is a "future `a`", waiting for an `[a]`.

We use the function `runReader` to "force" the `a` out of the `(Reader r) a`:

~~~haskell
-- given a `(Reader r) a` and an `r`, uses that `r` to finally get the `a`:
runReader :: (Reader r) a -> r -> a
~~~

~~~haskell
ghci> runReader futureLength [1,2,3]
3
ghci> runReader futureHead [1,2,3]
1
ghci> runReader futureOdd 6
False
ghci> runReader futureOdd 5
True
~~~

Welcome to the world of future values.

::::: {.note}
**Aside**

It is important to note here that `(Reader Int) Bool` and `(Reader [Int])
Bool` *do not exist* in the same world.  One lives in a `Reader Int` world ---
a world of future values awaiting an `Int`.  The other lives in a `Reader
[Int]` world --- a world of future values awaiting an `[Int]`.
:::::

Let's say I have a future `Int`.  Say, `futureLength`, waiting on an
`[a]`. And I have a function `(< 5) :: Int -> Bool`.  Can I apply `(< 5)` to
my future `Int`, in order to get a future `Bool`?

At first, no!  This future `Int` is useless!  I can't even use it in *any* of
my normal functions!  Time to reach for the exit button?

Oh --- but, because `Reader [a]` is a Functor, I can use `fmap` to turn `(< 5) ::
Int -> Bool` into `fmap (< 5) :: (Reader [a]) Int -> (Reader [a]) Bool`!

~~~haskell
!!!inside/reader.hs "futureShorterThan ::" "futureShorterThan5 ::" inside-my-world
~~~

~~~haskell
ghci> runReader futureShorterThan5 [1,2,3]
True
ghci> runReader (futureShorterThan 3) [1,2,3,4]
False
~~~

And voilà, we have a future `Bool`.  We turned an `Int -> Bool` into a
function that takes a future `Int` and returns a future `Bool`.  We *applied
`(< 5)` to our future length*, to get a future `Bool` telling us if that length
is less than 5.

So `futureShorterThan` is a function that takes an `Int` and turns it into a
future `Bool`.  Let's go...deeper.  What if I wanted to apply
`futureShorterThan` to a *future* `Int`?  To *still* get a future `Bool`?

I can't apply `futureShorterThan` to a future `Int` straight-up, because it
only takes `Int`.  Boo!  But, wait --- `Reader [Int]` is a Monad, so that
means I can take the `Int -> (Reader [a]) Bool` and turn it into a `(Reader
[a]) Int -> (Reader [a]) Bool` using `(=<<)`!

Using `(=<<)`, we turned a function from `Int` to a future `Bool` to a
function from a future `Int` to a future `Bool`.

~~~haskell
futureShorterThan       :: Int              -> (Reader [a]) Bool
(=<<) futureShorterThan :: (Reader [a]) Int -> (Reader [a]) Bool
~~~

Hm.  Let's try this out on a future `Int` we have...we can use `futureHead ::
(Reader [Int]) Int`.

~~~haskell
!!!inside/reader.hs "futureShorterThanHead ::" inside-my-world
~~~

So, we are applying `futureShorterThan` to the `Int` we got from `futureHead`.
And so we get a future `Bool` that tells us if that future `Int` we got from
the input list is shorter than the input list.

~~~haskell
ghci> runReader futureShorterThanHead [1,2,3]
False
ghci> runReader futureShorterThanHead [5,2,3]
True
~~~

Neat!

Now, we can live in a world of "future values", and now use all of our
"normal" functions on future values!

In another language, we might have had to do this complicated dance of
"forcing" futures to get the value (to "exit" the world of future values),
applying functions to that value, and going "back into" the future.

But now, we *don't have to be scared of future values*.  We can work with them
just as well as if they were normal values, and "leave" them as futures the
entire time, without ever forcing them until when we really need to, and only
force them *once*.

Who said futures were complicated, anyway?

### The world of "IO"

(The source code for this section is [also available online][insideio] for you
to play with!)

!!![insideio]:inside/io.hs

And now we go into the most infamous of Haskell worlds, `IO`.

`IO` is "kind of like" our `Reader r` world --- an `IO Int` is an `Int` that
*doesn't yet exist*...but that will be computed by a CPU/computer *when a CPU
executes it*.

In this sense, an `IO Int` is kind of like a little packet of Assembly or C
code --- it contains instructions (assembly commands, machine language) for a
computer to do this and that and eventually produce an `Int`.  An `IO String`
could, for example, be a little packet of C code that reads a file and outputs
the contents of that file.  The `String` doesn't exist yet --- but it will,
once the computer executes those commands.

If you've ever used a Unix operating system, there is a shell command `ls`
that lists the contents of a directory.  The actual `ls` program
is kind of like an `IO [FilePath]`.  The `[FilePath]` does not "exist"
inside" `ls` --- rather, `ls` is a program that promises a list of
`FilePath`s when it is executed by the computer or interpreter.

So an `IO String` doesn't "contain" a `String` --- it is a program that
*promises* a `String` in the future, when a computer eventually executes
it,[^exitio].

[^exitio]: An important distinction between `IO` and the other worlds we have
    looked at is that there is no way to "exit" the world of `IO` within
    Haskell. That is, there is no meaningful `IO a -> a`.

    If you think about it for a while, it kind of makes sense.  If `IO a` is
    assembly code for a computer...the only thing that can "get" that `a` is
    the computer itself --- by shifting those registers, ticking that program
    clock, reading from IO...

    Remember, *a Haskell program can only "evaluate"* expressions, *not
    "execute"* them.  The execution is the computer's job.  When you compile a
    Haskell program, the compiler takes whatever `IO ()` is named `main` in
    your program, *evaluates* it, and compiles it into a binary. Then you, the
    computer user, can *execute* that binary like any other binary (compiled
    from C or whatever).  Because you can never "exit" `IO` in your Haskell
    code, this makes `IO` an extreme version of the worlds we mentioned
    before; in the others, we could "exit" the world if we really wanted to.
    We only used `fmap` and `(=<<)` because it provided for beautiful
    abstractions.  This topic is discussed in depth at an [old blog
    post][iopurepost] of mine.

    Because of this, if it weren't for Functor and Monad, it would be
    extremely hard to do *anything* useful with `IO`!  We literally can't pass
    an `IO a` into *any* normal function.  We need Functor and Monad for us to
    *ever* work at all with our "future values" with normal functions!

[iopurepost]: http://blog.jle.im/entry/the-compromiseless-reconciliation-of-i-o-and-purity

One common IO object we are given is `getLine :: IO String`.  `getLine` is
kind of like the Unix program `cat` --- it promises a `String`, and it gets
that `String` by taking in from standard input.  That is, it is a program
that, when executed by a computer, pulls a line from stdin, and returns that
as the `String` it promises.  `getLine` contains instructions for a computer
to get a `String` from stdin.  A future/promised `String`.

We want to apply `length :: String -> Int` to that future/promised `String`,
to get us a future/promised `Int`.  Again, we can't apply `length` to
`getLine` directly --- but because `IO` is a Functor, we can use `fmap
length :: IO String -> IO Int`.

~~~haskell
getLine             :: IO String
length              :: String -> Int
fmap length         :: IO String -> IO Int
fmap length getLine :: IO Int
~~~

Neat!

We had a function that only worked on `String`, but we made it work the
"future/promised" `String` of `IO String`

Let's look at a function returning an IO action `wc`, which takes a filename
and returns a program that, when executed, promises an `Int` --- the number of
lines in that file.

~~~haskell
!!!inside/io.hs "wc ::"1 inside-my-world
~~~

So `wc "file.txt"` would evaluate to a computation that, when executed by a
computer, produces an `Int` (by loading the file from disk using system calls,
reading it, and counting the lines).

`wc` is a function that takes a (non-future, normal) `String`.

But what if we wanted to apply `wc` to `getLine`, the `IO String` we had?  We
want to apply `wc` to that "future `String`".  We can't apply it directly.  We
want to turn our `String -> IO Int` into an `IO String -> IO Int`.


Luckily, `IO` is a Monad, so we have `(=<<)` at our disposal.

~~~haskell
getLine        :: IO String
wc             :: String -> IO Int
(=<<) wc       :: IO String -> IO Int
wc =<< getLine :: IO Int
~~~

Neat!

What does `wc =<< getLine` do, as a program?  How does it compute that
`Int`?

Conceptually, it all sort of "makes sense" if you look at it from a high level
view.  `getLine` is an `IO String` ---  a future `String`.  `wc` takes a
`String` and returns a future `Int`.  If we "applied `wc` to `getLine`", we
would be applying `wc` to that future `String`, to get a future `Int`.

And so there we have it --- we *don't ever have to* actually work "directly"
with computed values `a` that are received from IO.  All we ever have to do is
work with `IO a`, and we can use *all of our normal functions* on that `IO a`,
as if they were normal `a`s.

In that way, we don't have to be scared of working with "future computable
values" --- we can use all of our normal tools on them!

Even more
---------

There are lots of other worlds besides just `Maybe`, `Reader r`, and `IO`.
Each one comes with their own unique semantics/meanings/contexts, and their
own answer for what `fmap` and `(=<<)` are supposed to "mean".

Here are some others --- with brief descriptions.

1.  The world of `Either e`, which is like `Maybe` in which things may or may
    not be there.  But in `Either e`, when things aren't there, they come with
    a reason why they are not (of type `e`).

2.  The world of `[]`, where things are the results of computations that have
    ambiguous answers.  I wrote a [series of posts][monadplus] on this :)

3.  The world of `State s`, which is a world of future things awaiting an `s`,
    which modify the `s` in the process.

4.  The world of `Parser`, which is a world of things that an input string
    will be parsed into.

[monadplus]: http://blog.jle.im/entries/series/+monadplus-success-failure-monads

There are many more!  The great thing about Haskell is that with `fmap` and
`(=<<)`, it is easy to work with values inside these worlds with all of your
normal functions, without any real extra effort.  Normal functions, normal
values, values inside worlds...we have them all at our disposal.

Haskell lets me stay *inside my world*!

Final Notes
-----------

For some further reading, Gabriella Gonzalez's ["Functor Design
Pattern"][tekmo] post covers a similar concept for people more familiar with
Haskell and explains it more elegantly than I ever could have.

Don't forget as you're reading and moving on that it's not
correct to say "Functors are worlds", or "Monads are worlds".  As I mentioned
before in an aside, Monads aren't "anything" other than the functions and the
laws.  Rather, if we look at `Maybe`, etc. as a "world", then *having a Monad
interface/instance* allows us to do cool things with that world.

Feel free to again [play around with][srcs] the code used here and load it in
ghci yourself!

Experienced readers might have noted an unconventional omission of
"Applicative Functors", which (since 2008-ish) traditionally goes somewhere in
between the section on Functor and the section on Monad.  Applicative
Functors, in this context, are handy in that they let you combine two values
in worlds together; that is, if you have a `Maybe a` and a `Maybe b`, it
allows you to use an `a -> b -> c` to "squash" them into a `Maybe c`.  This
squashing action is called `liftA2`.

As always, if you have any questions, leave them in the comments, or come find
me on freenode's #haskell --- I go by *jle`* :)
