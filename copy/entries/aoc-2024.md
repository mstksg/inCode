Admittedly a bit late, buuuuuut Merry belated Christmas and Happy New Years to
all!

This past December I again participated in Eric Wastl's [Advent of Code][], a
series of 25 daily Christmas-themed puzzles. Each puzzle comes with a cute
story about saving Christmas, and the puzzles increase in difficulty as the
stakes get higher and higher.  Every night at midnight EST, my friends and I
(including the good people of libera chat's `##advent-of-code` channel) discuss
the latest puzzle and creative ways to solve and optimize it. But, the main
goal isn't to solve it quickly, it's always to see creative ways to approach
the puzzle and share different insights. The puzzles are bite-sized enough that
there are often multiple ways to approach it, and in the past I've leveraged
[group theory][alchemical], [galilean transformations and linear algebra][gal],
and [more group theory][shuffle]. This year was also the special 10 year
anniversary event, with callbacks to fun story elements of all the previous
years!

[gal]: https://blog.jle.im/entry/shifting-the-stars.html
[shuffle]: https://blog.jle.im/entry/shuffling-things-up.html

Most of the puzzles are also pretty nice to solve in Haskell! Lots of DFS's
that melt away as simple recursion or recursion schemes, and even the BFS's
that expose you to different data structures and encodings.

This year I've moved _almost_ all of my Haskell code to [an Advent of Code
Megarepo][megarepo].  I also like to post write-ups on Haskelly ways to approach
the problems, and they are auto-compiled on the [megarepo wiki][reflections].

I try my best every year, but sometimes I am able to complete write-ups for all
25 puzzles before the new year catches up. The last time was [2020][], and I'm
proud to announce that 2024 is now also 100% complete!

You can find [all of them here][reflections-2024], but here are links to each
individual one.  Hopefully you can find them helpful.  And if you haven't yet, why
not try [Advent of Code][] yourself? :)  And drop by the freenode
`##advent-of-code` channel, we'd love to say hi and chat, or help out!  Thanks
all for reading, and also thanks to Eric for a great event this year, as
always!
