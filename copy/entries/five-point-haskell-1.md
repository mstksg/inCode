Times have changed. The entire discipline of software development and
engineering is under question, and over the past years has come under multiple
movements re-thinking what it even means to write good, robust, correct code.
Multiple language and framework wars have been fought, the zeitgeist constantly
shifts. It is long overdue to clarify exactly the mindset on which we approach
and define "good" coding principles. This series sets to establish a five-point
unified framework of the "Typed Functional Programming" (and Haskell-derived)
programming philosophy aimed to create code that is maintainable, correct,
long-lasting, extensible, and beautiful to write and work with, in terms of
dispelling "heresies" (thought leader sound-bytes that have become all too
popular on Twitter) and clarifying the tried and true refutations and
guiding rules.

Let's jump right into point 1: Total Depravity.
