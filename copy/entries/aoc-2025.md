Merry Christmas all! This is my annual [Advent of Code][] post! Advent of Code
is a series of (this year) 12 daily Christmas-themed programming puzzles that
are meant to be fun diversions from your daily life, help you find a bit of
whimsy in your world, give you a chance to explore new ideas and program
together with your friends. I always enjoy discussing creative ways to solve
these puzzles every day, and it's become a bit of an annual highlight for me
and a lot of others. My favorite part about these puzzles is that they are
open ended enough that there are usually many different interesting
ways to solve them --- it's not like a stressful interview question where you
have to recite the obscure incantation to pass the test. In the past I've leveraged
[group theory][alchemical], [galilean transformations and linear algebra][gal],
and [more group theory][shuffle].

Haskell is especially fun for these because if you set up your abstractions in
just the right way, the puzzles seem to solve themselves. It's a good
opportunity every year to get exposed to different parts of the Haskell
ecosystem! Last year, I moved almost all of my Haskell code to [an Advent of
Code Megarepo][megarepo], and I also write up my favorite ways to solve each
one in the [megarepo wiki][reflections].

All of this year's 12 puzzles [are here][reflections-2025], but I've also
included links to each individual one in this post. I'm also considering
expanding some of these into full on blog posts, so be on the look out, or let
me know if there are any that you might want fully expanded! And if you
haven't, why not try these out yourself? Be sure to drop by the libera-chat
`##advent-of-code` channel to discuss any fun ways you solve them, or any
questions! Thanks again to Eric for a great new fresh take on the event this
year!
