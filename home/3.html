In this post we’re going to be exploring the idea of enhancing normal data types with different types of functor structures step-by-step, by starting with a simple useful structure and enhancing it piece by piece in order to reap incremental benefits. This process reflects a lot of the way I personally work through these things — I normally don’t get the whole powerful structure all the way; instead I incrementally add things as I see how things fit together.</p>
<p>We’re going build the tools to describe a <em>data type schema</em>, which can represent algebraic data types — sums and products. We’ll start off just building things we can use to <em>describe</em> the schema (by printing out documentation), and by the end of the journey we’ll also be able to use our schema to generate parsers and serializers through json.</p>
<p>This interest in functor structures culminated in my <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/functor-combinatorpedia.html">Functor Combinatorpedia</a> post last year and the <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/functor-combinators">functor-combinators</a></em> library. But personally I had never really explored the less commonly used lowercase-f functor abstractions in Hask — contravariant functors and invariant functors until recently.</p>
<p>This series is designed for an intermediate Haskeller with familiarity in things like product/sum types, using <code>Applicative</code>/<code>Alternative</code>, and monadic parser combinators, and is written in sync with <em>functor-combinators-0.3.6.0</em>.</p><p><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/enhancing-functor-structures-step-by-step-1.html" class="link-readmore">Read more &hellip; </a> <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/enhancing-functor-structures-step-by-step-1.html#disqus_thread" class="link-comment">Comments</a></p></div><footer><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/functional-programming.html" class="tag-a-tag">#functional programming</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/free.html" class="tag-a-tag">#free</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/haskell.html" class="tag-a-tag">#haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/interpreters.html" class="tag-a-tag">#interpreters</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/invariant-functors.html" class="tag-a-tag">#invariant functors</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/functor-combinators.html" class="tag-a-tag">#functor combinators</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/category/@haskell.html" class="tag-a-category">@HASKELL</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/series/+enhancing-functor-structures.html" class="tag-a-series">+Enhancing Functor Structures</a></li></ul></footer></article></li><li><article class="tile"><header><time datetime="2020-01-23T18:16:52Z" pubdate="" class="pubdate">Thursday January 23, 2020</time><h3><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/introducing-the-mutable-library.html">Introducing the mutable library</a></h3></header><div class="entry-lede copy-content"><p><strong>mutable</strong>: <a href="https://mutable.jle.im/">documentation</a> / <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mutable">reference</a> / <a href="https://github.com/mstksg/mutable">github</a></p>
<p>(<em>Note:</em> This post has been heavily revised to reflect <em>mutable-0.2.0.0</em>, as of July 2020. For reference, <a href="https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/blob/7c25dd3798955e8287d31774da6fe34015256b5a/entry/introducing-the-mutable-library.md">the original post</a> is available on github.)</p>
<p>I’m excited to announce the release of the <em><a href="https://mutable.jle.im/">mutable</a></em> library!</p>
<p>The library offers what I call <em>beautiful mutable values</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> — automatic, composable piecewise-mutable references for your data types. Sort of like an automatically generated <code>MVector</code>, but for all your <code>ADT</code>s.</p>
<p>My high-level goal was a composable and overhead-free solution for dealing with mutable values in Haskell in a type-safe and clean way. After all, why do imperative languages have to have all the fun? In Haskell, we can have the best of both worlds: efficient and clean mutable algorithms <em>and</em> type safety.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mutable.jle.im/">official documentation and homepage is here</a>, so it’s a good read if you want to be introduced to how to use the library and where it is most effective. But I’m going to use this blog post to talk about <em>why</em> I wrote the library, some of the neat things you can do with it, and the techniques that went into writing it.</p>

They deal with one of my favorite “practical” libraries in Haskell, and also one of the more “profound” category theory-inspired abstractions in Haskell. In the process, it made the library a bit more useful to me, and also made the concept a bit more concrete and understandable to me.</p>
<p>This post mainly goes through my thought process in finding this out — it’s very much a “how I think through this” sort of thing — in the end, the goal is to show how much this example made me further appreciate the conceptual idea of adjunctions and how they can pop up in interesting places in practical libraries. Unlike most of my other posts, it’s not about necessarily about how practically useful an abstraction is, but rather what insight it gives us to understanding its instances.</p>
<p>The audience of this post is Haskellers with an understanding/appreciation of abstractions like <code>Applicative</code>, but be aware that the final section is separately considered as a fun aside for those familiar with some of Haskell’s more esoteric types.

For me, this involves designing a protocol from scratch every time with varying levels of hand-rolled authentication and error detection (Send this byte for this command, this byte for this other command, etc.). Once I design the protocol, I then have to write both the command line client and the server — something I usually do from scratch over the raw TCP streams.</p>
<p>This process was fun (and informative) the first few times I did it, but spinning it up from scratch again every time discouraged me from doing it very often. However, thankfully, with the <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant">servant</a></em> haskell library (and <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-cli">servant-cli</a></em>, for command line clients), writing a TCP server/client pair for a TCP service (using HTTP under the hood) becomes dead-simple — the barrier for creating one fades away that designing/writing a service becomes a tool that I reach for immediately in a lot of cases without second thought.</p>
<p><em>servant</em> is usually advertised as a tool for writing web servers, web applications, and REST APIs, but it’s easily adapted to write non-web things as well. Let’s dive in and write a simple TCP/IP service (a todo list manager) to see how straightforward the process is!</p>
<p>To goal of this article is to take service/program that you already have planned out, and <em>easily provide</em> it with a networked API that can be used over any TCP/IP connection (over the internet, or even locally). This won’t teach you <em>how</em> to write a todo app, but rather how to <em>hook up</em> a todo app over a TCP/IP connection quickly, with a command line client — and in such a simple way that you wouldn’t give a second thought based on complexity issues.</p>
<p>This post can also serve as a stepping-stone to a “microservices architecture”, if you intend to build towards one (this is explored deeper by <a href="https://github.com/k-bx/owlcloud">k-bx</a>)…but really it’s more focused for standalone user-facing applications. How you apply these techniques is up to you :)</p>
<p>All of the code in this article is available online, and the server and client are available as “stack executables”: if you download them all, and set the permissions properly (<code>chmod u+x</code>), you can directly run them to launch the server and client (if they are all download to the same directory).</p><p><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/simple-tcpip-services-servant.html" class="link-readmore">Read more &hellip; </a> <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/simple-tcpip-services-servant.html#disqus_thread" class="link-comment">Comments</a></p></div><footer><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/functional-programming.html" class="tag-a-tag">#functional programming</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/haskell.html" class="tag-a-tag">#haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/servant.html" class="tag-a-tag">#servant</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/category/@haskell.html" class="tag-a-category">@HASKELL</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/category/@tutorials.html" class="tag-a-category">@TUTORIALS</a></li></ul></footer></article></li><li><article class="tile"><header><time datetime="2019-06-19T10:41:46Z" pubdate="" class="pubdate">Wednesday June 19, 2019</time><h3><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/functor-combinatorpedia.html">The Functor Combinatorpedia</a></h3></header><div class="entry-lede copy-content"><p><strong>functor-combinators</strong>: <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/functor-combinators">hackage</a> / <a href="https://github.com/mstksg/functor-combinators">github</a></p>
<p>(<em>Note:</em> This post has been heavily revised to reflect the functor-combinators-0.2 refactoring, as of November 2019.

<p>(<em>Note 2:</em> The section on contravariant functor combinators was added following the release of <em>functor-combinators-0.3</em> in August 2020, which added support for contravariant and invariant functor combinators.)</p>
<p>Recently I’ve been very productive what I have been calling the “Functor Combinator” design pattern. It is heavily influenced by ideas like <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~W.Swierstra/Publications/DataTypesALaCarte.pdf">Data types a la Carte</a> and <a href="http://oleg.fi/gists/posts/2018-02-21-single-free.html">unified free monoidal functors</a>, but the end goal is slightly different in spirit. The goal is to represent schemas, DSL’s, and computations (things like parsers, things to execute, things to consume or produce data) by assembling “self-evident” basic primitives and subjecting them to many <em>different</em> successive transformations and combiners (through combinators, free structures, tensors, and other options). The process of doing so:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Forces you to make explicit decisions about the structure of your computation type as an ADT.</li>
<li>Allows you to retain isolation of fundamental parts of your domain as separate types</li>
<li>Lets you manipulate the structure of your final computation type through <em>normal Haskell techniques</em> like pattern matching. The structure is available throughout the entire process, so you can replace individual components and values within your structure.</li>
<li>Allows you to fully <em>reflect</em> the structure of your final computation through pattern matching and folds, so you can inspect the structure and produce useful summaries.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like “data types a la carte” and free monad/applicative/alternative designs, these techniques allow you to separate the assembly and inspection of your programs from the “running” of them.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> However, the main difference is that here we focus not just on products and sums, but many different varied and multi-purpose combinators — a “zoo” of combinators. The fixed point is <em>not</em> the end goal. The actual ADT data types <em>themselves</em> are the goal.</p>
<section id="footnotes" class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>On the surface, this functor combinator design pattern might look like it fills a similar space to effects systems and libraries like <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl">mtl</a></em>, <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy">polysemy</a></em>, <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/freer-simple">freer-simple</a></em>, or <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fused-effects">fused-effects</a></em>. However, this design pattern actually exists on a different level.</p>
<p>Functor combinator design patterns can be used to help build the <em>structure</em> of the <em>data types</em> and schemas that define your program/DSL. Once you build these nice structures, you then <em>interpret</em> them into some target context. This “target context” is the realm that libraries like <em>mtl</em> and <em>polysemy</em> can fill; functor combinators serve to help you define a structure for your program <em>before</em> you interpret it into whatever Applicative or Monad or effects system you end up using.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<p>Free structures are some of my favorite tools in Haskell, and I’ve actually written a few posts about them before, including <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/alchemical-groups.html">this one using free groups</a>, <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/interpreters-a-la-carte-duet.html">this one on a free monad variation</a>, and <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/const-applicative-and-monoids.html">this one on a “free” applicative on a monoid</a>.</p>
<p>Regular expressions (and parsers) are ubiquitous in computer science and programming, and I hope that demonstrating that they are pretty straightforward to implement using free structures will help you see the value in free structures without getting too bogged down in the details!</p>
<p>All of the code in this post is <a href="https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/tree/master/code-samples/misc/regexp.hs">available online</a> as a “stack executable”. When you run it (<code>./regexp.hs</code>), you’ll load up a <em>ghci</em> session with all of the definitions in scope, so you can play around with the functions and types :)</p>

<p>This inspired me to try playing around with some tries myself, and it gave me an excuse to play around with <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/recursion-schemes">recursion-schemes</a></em> (one of my favorite Haskell libraries). If you haven’t heard about it yet, <em>recursion-schemes</em> (and the similar library <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/data-fix">data-fix</a></em>) abstracts over common recursive functions written on recursive data types. It exploits the fact that a lot of recursive functions for different recursive data types all really follow the same pattern and gives us powerful tools for writing cleaner and safer code, and also for seeing our data types in a different light. The library is a pathway to many viewpoints — some considered to be particularly natural.</p>
<p>Recursion schemes is a perfect example of those amazing accidents that happen throughout the Haskell ecosystem: an extremely “theoretically beautiful” abstraction that also happens to be extremely useful for writing industrially rigorous code.</p>
<p>Is it possible to learn this power? Yes! As a fun intermediate-level Haskell project, let’s build a trie data type in Haskell based on <em>recursion-schemes</em> to see what it has to offer!</p><p><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/tries-with-recursion-schemes.html" class="link-readmore">Read more &hellip; </a> <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/tries-with-recursion-schemes.html#disqus_thread" class="link-comment">Comments</a></p></div><footer><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/haskell.html" class="tag-a-tag">#haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/recursion-schemes.html" class="tag-a-tag">#recursion schemes</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/category/@haskell.html" class="tag-a-category">@HASKELL</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/category/@tutorials.html" class="tag-a-category">@TUTORIALS</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/series/+beginner-intermediate-haskell-projects.html" class="tag-a-series">+Beginner/Intermediate Haskell Projects</a></li></ul></footer></article></li><li><article class="tile"><header><time datetime="2018-12-10T16:34:37Z" pubdate="" class="pubdate">Monday December 10, 2018</time><h3><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/shifting-the-stars.html">Shifting the Stars: Advent of Code with Galilean Optimization</a></h3></header><div class="entry-lede copy-content"><p>(TL;DR: scroll down to the very bottom for a summary and the closed form solution)</p>
<p>Another short Advent of Code post! <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018">Advent of Code 2018</a> is in full swing; we’re 40% of the way through. Every once in a while, if I find a fun way to solve a problem, I’ll make a short post about it. You can check out my other ones <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/series/+advent-of-code.html">here on the series page</a>, and you can also find my <a href="https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2018/blob/master/reflections.md">daily reflections</a> here, as well. And, again, if you’re following along in Haskell, why not hop on <a href="https://twitter.com/glguy">glguy’s</a> semi-official <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018/leaderboard/private">Haskell Leaderboard</a> (join code <code>43100-84040706</code>)! There are also Haskellers on freenode ##adventofcode, and also #adventofcode on the Functional Programming slack. You might also find my <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/advent-of-code-api">advent of code api</a> haskell bindings helpful too!</p>
<p>Today, we’re going to be using linear algebra, calculus, and galilian transformations to solve the <em>Day 10</em> challenge. (That’s right, this isn’t just a Haskell blog, I do have <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/category/@math.html">math</a> posts on occasion too :) )</p><p><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/shifting-the-stars.html" class="link-readmore">Read more &hellip; </a> <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/shifting-the-stars.html#disqus_thread" class="link-comment">Comments</a></p></div><footer><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/advent-of-code.html" class="tag-a-tag">#advent of code</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/linear-algebra.html" class="tag-a-tag">#linear algebra</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/physics.html" class="tag-a-tag">#physics</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/category/@math.html" class="tag-a-category">@MATH</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/series/+advent-of-code.html" class="tag-a-series">+Advent of Code</a></li></ul></footer></article></li></ul><footer class="tile home-footer"><nav><ul><li class="home-next"><a href="https://blog.jle.im/home/4.html">&larr; Older</a></li><li class="home-prev"><a href="https://blog.jle.im/home/2.html">Newer &rarr;</a></li></ul><div class="clear"></div></nav></footer></div><nav class="unit one-of-four home-sidebar"><div class="tile"><div class="home-links"><ul>
